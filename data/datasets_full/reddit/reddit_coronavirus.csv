11/29/2021 6:37,">We already know it has the same amino acid substitutions as b.1.351 (Beta) plus a bunch of one of unknown impact.

Not exactly. The amino acid substitution that you are thinking of is at position E484 in the RBD. The Beta variant has an E484K mutation while Omicron has E484A. The RBD of the original spike protein (used in the vaccines) has Glutamate at E484. The Beta variant has Lysine (K) at E484. It looks like the Omicron variant has Alanine (A) in that position. The E484 position is a major target of immune reaction against the receptor binding domain, which seem to be the part of the spike that the immune system has the strongest reactions against."

Then again you could argue people not wearing masks are not being careful while doing other things, but that's just an hypothesis."

when you say it's in the eighties now it's because they are now including vaccinated blood serum in their testing

in other words you've literally just proven to everyone why we should all get vaccinated

because the immunity provided by infection isn't durable

11/29/2021 7:05,"That's true when looking at individual hosts in isolation, but not true when considering the macro social context. If a virus is more deadly, we'll lock down and create booster variants targeting it specifically. If a variant is less severe, we'll let it run rampant and eventually not even vaccinate for it (the common colds). Over time, the latter become the dominant strands."
11/29/2021 7:04,I don’t think it’s really a thing.  We recently travelled in for a vaccine only show and enjoyed the safe dining/venues compared to our home state.
11/29/2021 7:04,"The mistake here is thinking that travel bans in this situation is a punishment. The Governments of the US, UK, EU and other nations have protecting their citizens as their highest duty. They would be failing in this duty if they were to continue to allow unimpeded travel to and from a part of the world where this virus is spreading without knowing more about the scope of the spread in SA and the high potential for Omicron to evade exisiting antibodies.

 It is a quarantine to try to limit the spread of a potentially game changing virus to other parts of the world, not an imposition of economic sanctions."
11/29/2021 7:04,It can still mutate so you would want a combo of vaccinations and limiting the exposure and spread.
11/29/2021 7:03,"The number from Spanish flu is an estimate but you're using reported cases for COVID. If you used reported cases for Spanish Flu it would be like 500,000 .

If no vaccine passports used its even harsher capacity limits."
11/29/2021 7:02,No
11/29/2021 7:02,"There is also something clearly wring with the testing or testing verification system. Supposedly, everyone on those flights had to have a negative test to board (IMHO they should require vax too, but they don’t). I’ve heard a bunch of speculation as to why that ten percent wasn’t caught. Everything from fake test results being rampant, to tests not being accurate (OK, so require two maybe), to it being caught on the flight due to lack of masking/ventilation, or some combo. Stopping Covid from crossing friendly land borders is super hard but stopping it from flying all over the world unchecked should be easier and help slow these kinds of outbreaks."

Such an amazing era we live in that that can happen!"
11/29/2021 7:00,"COVID has killed way more than that.

18 million to Spanish flu is a retrospective figure because nobody recorded cases back then.

COVID will have its own retrospective figure because more than half the countries again don't record case numbers worth anything. And even the ones that do are only getting ~1/2 of them. 

Worldwide I would be surprised if even 1/4 of COVID deaths are reported."
11/29/2021 7:00,"You’re obviously going to have to wait for the production… approval… distribution… the inevitable bottleneck for vaccines as everyone is going to want one at once.

11/29/2021 7:00,"This is bullshit dude. This is all in your head.

Experts, the FDA, the CDC, Dr. Fauci, have been talking about the possibility of variants requiring a vaccine update from practically day one. 

Just because antivaxxers imagined an alternate reality where none of that happened doesn't mean anyone outside of your echo chamber is living in it."
11/29/2021 7:00,"There is selective pressure on a virus to mutate into a less deadly variant. Not so much at an individual level (where a long incubation can bypass that), but at a macro social level, where a more deadly virus will lead to lockdowns and dedicated boosters targetting it, whereas a less leathal version will generally be left to run rampant."
11/29/2021 7:00,Is milder cases confirmed with more sample sizes? Would be good if it wasn't serious like the south african doctor said and does anyone have more information on weird symptoms like high blood pressure?

11/29/2021 6:59,Yes they are. Or at least part of it. If we had done that with the original strain  it may have been contained. All countries need to stop travel for a few weeks
11/29/2021 6:59,Yeah I don't know where this 'they know something we don't' narrative is coming from.
11/29/2021 6:59,Travel bans do not make sense unless they are across the board. We don’t know where omicron originated nor all the places it has already spread to.

The good news is that 94% of adults are vaccinated in Manhattan, 97% in Queens, Bronx, SI and Brooklyn follow (in that order from more to less) in the high 80’s. I don’t want a bunch of unvaccinated people here but at some point we have to just accept we have done all we can.

[But every so often, direct descendants of the 1918 flu combined with bird flu or swine flu to create powerful new pandemic strains, which is exactly what happened in 1957, 1968 and 2009.

11/29/2021 6:49,"Just a question. If the Omicron strain proves to have much milder symptoms, would it not be best to encourage that strain to become dominant over the more harmful ones? Kind of like selective breeding.  
  
I mean, either way we’re stuck with covid and exposure to a milder form of the virus is pretty much like traditional vaccines. The mortality rate is likely higher than a vaccine, but it’d do the job of “vaccinating” the antivaxxers, with a lower risk profile for those that are high risk.  
  
Idk, I’m no doctor or epidemiologist or whatever, so I’m quite prepared for this to be wrong on any number of fundamental levels, that are more obvious to someone that works in the field (so go easy on me). It was just a thought and a contagious “vaccine” would appear to circumvent the whole problem with vaccinations. Though I’m guessing that the vaccine manufacturers wouldn’t be too happy with that.  
  
Oh and perhaps omicron isn’t the right strain, but the same could be applied to a future strain with an even lower risk profile.  
  
Lastly, everyone who wants to, could still get vaccinated. Governments just wouldn’t have to push the issue so hard.

“Omicron has an unprecedented number of spike mutations, some of which are concerning for their potential impact on the trajectory of the pandemic,” the WHO said. “The overall global risk related to the new variant of concern Omicron is assessed as very high.“

Further research was needed to better understand Omicron’s potential to escape protection against immunity induced by vaccines and previous infections, it said, adding that more data was expected in coming weeks.

The UK was the first country where it became the dominant variants, by some margin. You'd expect that anywhere a variant with a transmission advantage is introduced, it will become dominant at some point and the sooner the variant is introduced, the sooner dominance is achieved.

The fact that Alpha became dominant in the UK well before it did anywhere else strongly suggests that it was introduced in the UK before it was introduced anywhere else, meaning it originated in the UK. That's not a certainty, but it's by far the most likely scenario."

there are other studies which say 80Celsius for couple of seconds is enough to kill the viruses if the heat is same all over the mask, so not only from one side"

11/29/2021 11:39,"No, T cells look at all proteins, not just the spike proteins like the antibodies.

You still have an immune response (they look at the whole virus, not just spike proteins). Imagine those people not having any vax or infection. Their T and B cells were never trained for covid and they have to respond from scratch. Vaccinated/already infected have already trained cells so they dont have to start from scratch, and the immune system reacts much faster. It is like a blueprint the body can immediately recover to quickly deal with any variant as it looks like largely the same virus.

Bodies dont like to keep antibodies it doesnt need, hence the reduction in antibodies over time. Thats why you have those T and B cells."

If vaccinated people are spared most of the trauma of the illness (generally, there'll be exceptions obvs) the unvaxxed will mainly take out each other. We all know that.

One thing about Japan that hasn't been reported in western media is the attitude in the rural areas towards covid. I live in a rural area, lots of older people, not as many medical facilities. In April 2020 one college-aged girl brought back covid and it spread to her family that lives here. That family eventually moved because they were ostracized by their neighbors so much. People here were probably more afraid of the social consequences of getting covid than the virus itself. That kind of pressure from nosy gossipy old folks in rural communities probably did more to keep covid numbers down than anything the government did."

11/29/2021 11:11,"One important factor many don't consider is testing: We do a LOT of testing, so we find many cases that would go undetected in many other countries. Every pupil in Austria is tested at least 3 times a week (mandatory!), PCR tests are required for many activities. So the infection rates in other countries may appear lower, but may be higher.

Still, the situation is bad in parts of the country, some ERs are full, but the system is not collapsing (yet). We have a strong anti-vaxxer community, a major party in Austria (far-right, populist, racist FPÖ) promotes Ivermectin instead of vaccines.

11/29/2021 11:10,Well that says something about transmittability. Now to see if their symptoms worsen. We should get a lot of clarity in the next week.
11/29/2021 11:10,"Thirteen cases of the Ómicron variant have been identified in Portugal, the National Institute of Health Doutor Ricardo Jorge (INSA) announced this Monday, adding that the 13 positive samples are ""associated with cases of infection of Belenenses SAD players, since one of the positive cases had a recent trip to South Africa.

""Preliminary tests carried out at INSA strongly suggest that all 13 cases associated with Belenenses SAD players are related to the Ómicron variant of concern,"" reads the INSA statement sent to the press.

To ensure the break of transmission chains and following the precautionary principle in Public Health, ""pending further information regarding the transmission, impact and vaccine effectiveness against the Ómicron variant"", the institute states that health authorities ""determined the prophylactic isolation of contacts of the infection cases associated with this outbreak, regardless of vaccination status and level of exposure"".

""These contacts remain isolated and will undergo regular testing as early as possible at day 5 and day 10,"" the institute says.

New variant discovered in South Africa has an increased risk of reinfection.

INSA also indicates that it has analyzed samples from ""218 passengers on a flight from Maputo that landed at Lisbon airport on November 27th"".

On this flight from the capital of Mozambique, ""only two positives were detected, one of them being associated with the variant Delta and the other not allowing the correct identification"", and INSA has begun genome sequencing for final confirmation of these cases. However, ""the predictive value of the tests already performed is very high"".

The Dr. Ricardo Jorge National Institute of Health recalls that the new variant, initially identified in South Africa and some southern African countries, has also been identified in recent days in some European countries. ""However, there is still no scientific data to support its greater transmissibility or its ability to reduce the effectiveness of current vaccines,"" said the INSA in the statement.

Like other countries, Portugal has also taken measures against this new variant, considered of ""concern"" by the World Health Organization (WHO). The INSA says that throughout the territory the health authorities ""strengthen epidemiological surveillance, implementing control measures, with the prophylactic isolation of contacts of cases of infection by the Ómicron variant or with a history of travel to southern Africa in the previous 14 days, regardless of vaccination status, the precautionary principle in Public Health.

INSA continues to monitor the genetic variants of the new coronavirus, stressing that ""Portugal is aware of this situation, maintaining its ongoing monitoring program of variants at national level"".

Yes they can. Those masks are usually used at work places, if you go grocery shopping for 20 minutes its reasonably understandable that this doesnt equal a shift of 8 hours.

Well they just started mandating masks yesterday I believe.

This is not true, our COVID cases per capita are significantly lower than some of the countries that are banning travel from here. 

Secondly, there is no evidence that this variant originated here. The fact that it, along with the Beta variant, were discovered here is simply a function of the fact that we are better at sequencing these variants than other countries. 

Lastly, it's not about feelings, but economics. SA is a small developing country that is heavy reliant on foreign capital injection. These travel bans are going to wreck havoc in the economy."

Higher transmissibility then delta is going to impact hospitals and access to medical care. An R0 over 10 is gonna hurt even if this ends up being less deadly like if it were to have a mortality rate similar to the flu and it hypothetically only severely effected the unvaccinated.

That level of transmissibility is way beyond what hospitals can cope with even of lesser diseases and it will spread through whatever populations ends up being vulnerable to infection way too fast to accommodate those requiring medical attention. That prevents access to all other reasons we need emergency care and pushes medical workers out of health care just do to the conditions of which kills more people.

As of I right now I’d prefer not to think about it being as deadly as covid, hopefully we get a break there but limited data in transmissibility is one of the reasons why we’re seeing a bigger response to this than even delta ended up receiving."

11/29/2021 9:45,"That’s what I’ve always theorized, is that during the pandemic, Japan is probably trying to enjoy their former glory days of isolation from the world as long as possible. Covid’s a convenient excuse to kinda “keep Japan just for the Japanese” as long as possible. Also what I really hate is that Japan wants to stay closed off, but have no problem sending their students, workers, etc all around the world while everyone else isn’t pushing hard enough for reciprocal agreements and recognizing vaccine certificates. For example, I was supposed to go to grad school in Tokyo this fall which obviously didn’t happen. Yet my friend from Yokohama and some of her friends were able to go to LA just fine, just had to prove they were vaccinated and good to go. As happy as I am for her to be in LA doing a year of study abroad, I can’t help but feel some sort of resentment."

All these measures are pointless. Learn how to coexist with the virus. Also there are reports showing the variant is only causing mild diseases in SA."
11/29/2021 9:43,Ironically it's the idiots too brainwashed to get vaccinated that are fueling the moneymaking. We could've been out of this mess by now.
11/29/2021 9:43,I mean that's from an objective standpoint perfect sense. Natural antibodies are doing just as well as shots. They don't need to get them just as well as those who've had shots should now contract the virus just to boost their immune system even more.

Just think about Delta, it only has 3 mutations on the spike protein and that was enough to lower the efficacy of the vaccine to the point that you still could get infected with Covid, but the vaccine still offered you protection enough to not land in the hospital in the ICU at least that was the selling point after Delta, but now, with Omicron and 10 mutations, the vaccine could be good for nothing, and that's everyone's biggest fear for now and why all these governments are overreacting with closing their border, this whole situation is starting to look more like early 2020.

On the bright side, the FDA says that the vaccines can easily be ""tuned"" to fight the new variant."

Do you believe that the daily positive rate in the US has been ever maintained under 5%?   No, far from that. In fact, even the duration with higher than 5% positive rate in the US so far has been much longer than that in Japan. I recommend you to see the ""Daily new confirmed COVID-19 cases per million people"" chart on Our World Data site which also shows the positive rates of countries during the pandemic and to compare between Japan and the US."

Up against the kind of disease that covid is, if you wait and the disease gets in, it's already too late. For a super contagious disease like this it means in a matter of days to weeks, the entire population will be under threat of exposure, then hospitals will be overrun.

I think heavy handed measures make sense at the borders. Yes travelers will be banned. But if you are able to eliminate or keep cases down domestically, the people within can live largely normal lives (see Taiwan)."

You could have a 100% vaccination rate and this would still happen. You could lock down for 10 years and this would still happen.

A single person walking around with Omicron is not necessarily (a) infectious at that particular time or (b) intrinsically (based on a set of physical characteristics we still don't really understand) a superspreader.  It will take a number of unsuspecting walking-Omicrons for the variant to be 'everywhere soon'. 

Of course, the problem is that there almost certainly are a large number of unsuspecting Omicron spreaders now."

If Omicron was known to world governments to be truly horrendous and needing extreme reactions, they wouldn't be limiting themselves to travel bans. They wouldn't keep it secret either. For that matter, they wouldn't be capable of keeping it secret! Way too many people would know, a good number of them being scientists and medical professionals that care about humanity's well-being."
11/29/2021 9:24,"You can not prove where the variant predominantly is, also I am a South African living in the county and I can tell you that it did not originate here, the first case came from a tourist, our scientists picked it up and shared the info with the world, we have already seen that there are cases in countries outside SA both in Africa as well as Europe, Israel and Australia, and most likely all over the world already. For all we know it could have originated from some person in the USA that traveled to Botswana and then someone in Botswana traveled here. 

They talk about it being possible that it mutated in someone with HIV, look anything is possible but I mean even America and China has over a million people living with HIV/AIDS but because Africa has more cases in this regard the theory is that it must have been here that it all started… 

Then I see comments about vaccinations needing to be increased etc, people sure I understand why you think that will help and I’m sure it will, but a large portion of the world is still not vaccinated, just now maybe we have a new variant sprouting from Russia where the virus has mutated to better handle the cold or something. Then we will need another booster shot, one per variant every 7months… viruses mutate vax or no vax, we have had influenza for a hundred years and it still mutates even though we have a flu shot… personally I don’t feel like getting poked every 7months…

Theories, conspiracies and misinformation is all i have been hearing since this covid bullshit, nobody knows anything honestly and the media is also know to blow shit out of proportion, I don’t deny that covid is a real problem and that many people have lost their lives, it’s sad and unfair but welcome to life… this isn’t the first pandemic and it won’t be the last…"

Fun fact: South Africa almost had to put up its military bases as collateral to secure vaccines. Pfizer backed down when the story made the papers. To my knowledge no developed country had that requirement put on it.

As for the rest of Africa, they don’t have the buying power to compete with developed nations for vaccines. They just don’t. 

But how about focusing on the first world. They have plateaued at 60% at best. Why doesn’t the first world get to 90% and then start talking about vaccines."
11/29/2021 9:21,I remember the day Japan closed all of their schools. I emailed my kid’s principal to find out what their plan was. He responded that he hadn’t heard anything from the school district and was out on a field trip. I took my kid out of school the following day and got some weird looks from the front desk staff. It took the school two more weeks to close up. Japan was right back then and they’re probably right this time.
11/29/2021 9:21,"Not sure if you understand this comment thread, but it's about those who refuse to get vaccinated. They don't understand that it's not about them but rather about the most vulnerable of our society which includes the elderly. About 90% of all COVID deaths are above 55 years of age. Many of them are fully vaccinated. 

Currently we have a lockdown here in Austria to prevent the healthcare system from collapsing. I, like many others who are fully vaccinated, have to endure another lockdown because some think they don't want to get vaccinated. 

**Getting vaccinated isn't just about personal choice, but more about solidarity.** Our whole healthcare system, and social security net in Austria is based on solidarity."

Yes, the US throws its weight around.  Sometimes for good, sometimes for ill, but we're always willing to roll that Influence check.

The oil thing though: we ignore our own oil because sucking the world dry would leave us as the last huge source.  Imagine a world where OPEC is begging the US to cut oil production because we can flood the market and tank oil prices.  Probably not a good thing.  But I think that's what we're (we=the US) aiming for, and likely to achieve."

Ignoring the fact that the majority of Americans are not gun owners. It's just a handful that have an insane amount of guns or are collectors that distort the picture.  So people believe we are all packing when, in fact there aren't that many gun owners overall and even fewer people carry when they aren't hunting or going to a shooting range."

In many countries in Europe, more than 1% of the population is currently infected with the virus, at this very moment. Many countries are about to go into a general lockdown. Excuse me, but in comparison, as far as the handling of the pandemic goes, people in China are way better off."
11/29/2021 9:16,"Yes it is my response. I thought critically about the context, subtext, and your responses. 

Not sure why you feel the need to attack over my responses. You have your perspective, I have mine. I think your comment contributes to the erosion of trust in our pubic institutions, specifically the CDC and WHO. Eroding trust in public institutions that were designed to keep folks safe, especially during a pandemic seems like you are doing the larger public a disservice. 

You are essentially an armchair quarterback. What value are you adding here? You don’t trust the CDC or WHO, don’t think their real-time decisions make sense given what we know a year later, and are critical of many things but really don’t have anything of substance to say. I understand your perspective, I just think twice when I see people sowing distrust in institutions we need most in the midst of a pandemic. I mean be as critical as you wish, but you have to acknowledge that your comments don’t really do anything to evolve the discussion on public safety or our collective need to respond to a pandemic."

My entire arm from shoulder to elbow turned black, was hot to the touch and swelled up almost double it's normal size.  Not the dark purple people call black, but actual black. I got put on three different antibiotics for three weeks as well as high dose steroids, had to see my doctor daily for almost four months so he could measure it daily to make sure it was healing. I had multiple ultrasounds to see how badly my veins were disintegrating. Luckily I got to keep my arm. But that was over ten years ago and I still have a tumor at the injection site that the doctors don't want to mess with because they have no idea what it is and don't want to risk it leaking into my arm and causing problems. I'm high risk because by  42 I've already had a stroke, heart attack, and brain/brainstem damage unrelated to the stroke. And brain surgery unrelated to the stroke.

Of course, I think a far more likely answer is ""They don't know, so they have to prepare for the worst until there is better information.""

What matters is how many cases you get relative to many tests you do. Hence why the media popularized, out of context, Trump's phrase ""let's stop testing"" or however that went (Obama said something similar during his mandate when there was another new virus),

The US is testing a lot, which is a great thing, but people also get scared when they see there's a lot of cases... I mean no shit, you're testing everyone all the time, of course you're gonna detect a lot of cases!"

After the second vaccination, 31.3 % of the elderly had no detectable neutralizing antibodies in contrast to the younger group, in which only 2.2% had no detectable neutralizing antibodies.

> Creating such a “pseudovirus” — a viral stand-in that contains all of the mutations — takes time, but results may be available in about 10 days.

Neutralization against pseudovirus is always lower.  We went through this the first time back with the mink mutants.

Doing it right requires actual virus and a BSL-4 lab and takes longer.

Headlines from the pseudovirus will almost certainly be released soon and be alarmist.  It also doesn't really matter because they're testing neutralizing antibodies (although will have implications for spread, but anyone paying attention already expects it to become endemic, and may have implications for various monoclonal antibody treatments).

> Already, a computer simulation has predicted that those mutations may alter about six of the hundreds of regions that T cells can recognize, said Wendy Burgers, an immunologist at the University of Cape Town.

> That may not seem like much. But people make varying sets of T cells, so depending on which targets the mutations knock out, some people may barely be affected by Omicron — and others may be left vulnerable.

This is the real question to answer, but testing T-cell responses is much slower.

The death rate in vaccinated/recovered individuals is probably how we'll know first if the T-cell responses are still maintained, rather than lab results.  And the safe bet is that they are, and the reports out of South Africa that it causes milder disease are probably the first indications of that."

When the manager came out to say they'd run out of j&J for the day and can only offer Pfizer, they all went? The only other thing it might be in their case is if they were new to Germany (they were all from Eastern Europe somewhere and had an interpreter with them) and want J&J so they can start working quicker.

Hopefully covid doesn't turn into something worse, but given how much we as a species are ruining the earth, it isnt illogical to say we won't have another pandemic with another virus soon if we don't fix up our gross act of animal treatment. If wet markets dont get regulated and eradicated, they will just be ticking time bombs like they've always been.

Back in August when traveling to Hawaii from California, we couldn't find a free PCR test that would get turn around under 72 hours. There seemed to be a shortage at that time. You could get a ""travel"" PCR test that gets results in 2 hours (guarantee less than 24 hours), but pay 150 dollars per test. (note: in November we got one that sent results by next day)

If you have a new potentially explosive variant this is way more valuable to know than the small benefit you get from tourism in the small window where the ban is active.  And if you’re caught covering it up?  You could risk a travel ban until Covid completely dies down.  I’m the absence of an authoritarian government it would be hard to hide anyway.

I think severity of disease is hard to predict (and differs from person to person) but it has mutations for high transmission, high stability, high immune evasion and low detection. They already have the sequence, so all predictions are made based on other mutants with similar mutations. Now the only information they will have will come from patients directly after many people are infected - which will take a couple of months at least. Essentially they have all the information they will have for a while, so a decision needs to be made based on the current information very quickly."

11/29/2021 7:41,"Mutations can always go forward and backwards but there is a selective downhill pressure for the virus to evade the immune system and be less virulent.

Virulence is a double edged sword because you cut out the people you could be infecting by putting your host on their ass and less able to circulate you.

There is no teleology to evolution.  The virus could evolve to become more virulent or more transmissible or more host immune avoidant, it’s just that given enough time and enough hosts it will trend towards adaptations that favor its circulation."

11/29/2021 7:34,"Can you please give an example of ""constant shootings"" in US hospitals? 

Yes, the US has a gun problem. No, there are not contestant shootings in US hospitals."
11/29/2021 7:33,"Then wouldn't that just be more evidence to enact longer or more strict travel restrictions?  If the likelihood of another variant originating from Africa is high, wouldn't it be in the best interest of other countries to just put a long term travel ban in place and put pressure on increasing vaccinations or other preventative measures to prevent more variants from emerging?

You're right, it's probably in many places by now, but wouldn't shutting off the flow of the variant to all corners of the world be a smart move at least temporarily?  Like others have mentioned, it buys everyone some time to figure out how this one is different. It lets the countries that have had people come from South Africa get contact traced and isolated.  It can't be too many people at this point in the grand scheme of things. If it is as contagious as early reports make it out to be, isolating the majority of it in one area seems intuitive.

On the other hand, you may be right about the future repercussions of this decision.  But, say another variant is detected in a country, and that country, in an effort to prevent this from happening to them, withholds information about it.  Eventually that information would come out and I think the backlash and repercussions could possibly be worse than a temporary travel ban had they shared the info early. Especially if it's a smaller country that doesn't hold much sway in the world.  Living in the US, if a new variant came from here, I would expect other countries to put travel restrictions in place.  If I recall correctly, many did for US citizens early on.  I'm guessing some still do.  That's just too be expected in the times we are in.  

Say you have a boat.  And the boat has a bunch of leaks.  You know eventually the water is going to get so bad that it will sink.  You also have life boats, but it's going to take some time to get them loaded and get them away safely.  Would you try to plug some of those leaks so you can load more people in the lifeboats?  Would you have someone bailing water, knowing each minute you gain means more lives saved?  Pfizer has said it can get a new vaccine rolled out in 100 days of necessary.  Then it will take time to vaccinate people with this new batch.  All we need is a little time.

What is the argument against a travel ban, other than ""it's already spread all over""?"

I’m not sure what my health insurance situation is going to be like in 2022, and aside from long Covid, And extreme disability or death,if I had to go to the hospital for even a couple of days or, heck even one day, I would possibly be screwed financially even with the best health outcome

A small percentage difference when rates are all pretty high can mean a huge difference in the number of unvaccinated, which matters a lot more than the number of vaccinated for spread of COVID"

B cells are the cells that produce the antibodies.

However, the T and B cells recognize a wide variety of antigenic snippets so it is highly unlikely that the vaccines or previous infections will be useless against omicron. They just may not be *AS* effective against this strain.

I think what information is publicly available along with the unknowns that will probably be much better understood within 3 weeks means shutting down travel for 3 weeks until we know more is a good move. No one wants to be the next Italy/Spain/NYC around March 2020, getting hit hard by a novel variant before we know much about it."
11/29/2021 7:06,The populations are nowhere near the same size though lol
11/29/2021 7:06,"This is the third novel human coronavirus outbreak since 2002, it seems wild that so much of the fretting over potential pandemic viruses in that timeframe were over the idea of avian flu instead. The other two were much less transmissible because they rendered those that were ill a lot less mobile, which also allowed for classic trace and isolate techniques to actually tamp down the spread."
11/29/2021 7:06,"did you not notice the wave of UNVACCINATED death that just swept across the South

you're the one that's engaging in magical thinking right now and I've proven it several times

11/29/2021 17:37,Under 5s aren’t vaccinated yet and can get long covid. Omicron looks like it spreads easily between vaccinated people so should we not care about risks to babies and little kids?
11/29/2021 17:36,"Places should prepare, it is high risk, and they shouldn't just close borders to Southern Africa."
11/29/2021 17:36,Hospitalizations are far more important than cases. The hospitals in my area are fine.
11/29/2021 17:36,"Vaccines prevent illness but we're seeing it's not as good at preventing spread. As the science evolves, so do we. The virus doesn't care about our policies, it's gonna do what it's gonna do. The best we can do is keep up."
11/29/2021 17:36,"It apparently isn’t common knowledge.

11/29/2021 17:36,"You've got a weird fixation on this lol.

Tell you what.  I'll continue to be vaccinated and masked and distanced, and you should not do any of those things and focus only on obesity.  Let's see which one of us gets hospitalized for Covid first."
11/29/2021 17:36,"I don't see why we need airplanes to have social contact?

People returning to their home countries, still can. They do need to quarantine. 

This travel ban isn't going to last for years. It's just a couple of weeks to see what we are dealing with here.

Surely people can wait a couple of weeks to travel?

I suppose they are worried about the impact on the tourism industry but I don't think there were that many tourists going to South Africa during the pandemic anyway?"
11/29/2021 17:36,thanks
11/29/2021 17:36,Just keep protecting yourself.
11/29/2021 17:36,"In Czech it is ""deniers"" (popírači). The same word is used for Holocaust denial."
11/29/2021 17:35,What do you want me to say to that? I'm sorry they took their lives but the alternative is to let people run free and spread/kill others. We're in a lose/lose situation here. Nobody is winning.
11/29/2021 17:35,"Oh look, that thing that been a thing for years, now."
11/29/2021 17:35,"The opinion to drop NPIs and solely rely on vaccines is not only unscientific but also radical. This is what the ""im vaccinated so i dont care anymore"" bubble has to understand.

CDC is quite clear about masks even for vaccinated if incidence is higher than 50 or positive rate over 8%.

> If you’ve been fully vaccinated:

> You can resume activities that you did prior to the pandemic. To reduce the risk of being infected with the Delta variant and possibly spreading it to others, wear a mask indoors in public if you are in an area of substantial or high transmission. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html

Check which areas have high or substantial incidence here https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view"
11/29/2021 17:35,I didn't say that.  I said the media frenzy in relation to lambda.

11/29/2021 17:34,"Those were working and student visa, so I would recommend finding a backup plan now if your is a tourist visa"
11/29/2021 17:34,But if omicron is for sure less lethal and more transmissible it makes sense for us to want it to spread like wildfire to become the dominant strain....
11/29/2021 17:34,Most of the US is acting like covid is gone already. I'm starting to see people wearing masks (myself included) get silent judged/ridicule looks for doing the right thing.

11/29/2021 17:33,Redditors are fucking unhinged lmao
11/29/2021 17:33,"Then get them boosted. It’s not hard. 100s of places to go do it if you’re that worried. 

I’m fully vaccinated. I’m playing on going to South America at the end of December so I’m going to get boosted before. Nothing to worry about, nothing to be paranoid about. Just acting like an adult. 

The paranoia comes from media and people have nothing else to do but to be afraid of something"
11/29/2021 17:33,Irn bru on prescription
11/29/2021 17:33,I don't think so. What sane government would try to limit the spread of omicron and not test its citizens against it?

11/29/2021 17:32,Although it seems to be continually getting worse. Up to 9 deaths/week/million from 3 not long ago and cases are up another 45% this week....
11/29/2021 17:32,"Canada now, too. It's in the UK and Canada, it's in the USA, and thus is pretty much everywhere already."
11/29/2021 17:32,"Naah... You have a country that proven has way too many cases above than the average country, what would you do? Would you keep the gates open or try to shut them?

I understand that they are loosing a lot of money, but instead of raising pointers SA should try to vaccinate its citizens"
11/29/2021 17:32,Countries also slapped travel bans on the UK when alfa was found. And on India for delta. It's normal.
11/29/2021 17:32,Oh if it’s in Canada it will be in the US anytime now. I’m guessing New York sometime today. Damn.

11/29/2021 17:30,"This is what I want to know. Why would the virus quit mutating? It seems this is forever and no one wants to admit it.

In addition, there is no possible way vaccination will be the cure because it will never NEVER be taken by everyone. 

Prove me wrong please."
11/29/2021 17:30,"So let people live their lives at the expense of other's, got it. Normal rules don't apply during a pandemic, people need to just suck it up and realize they aren't living in normal times. Sucks but it is what it is."

11/29/2021 17:29,Is he one of those 'sovereign citizen' types?
11/29/2021 17:29,I never wrote that data would make it true. My point is that we need more data to better ascertain the seriousness of the new variant.
11/29/2021 17:29,The market realizes that each crisis will see huge injections of public money in the form of bailouts.
11/29/2021 17:29,"Yeah. I’ve already accepted that this year of college is probably a wash again, as depressing as it is, but I’m not giving up my senior year. 

People my age deserve at least one unbroken, normal year of college. We’re going into debt for this shitty experience."
11/29/2021 17:28,All over. Look into the mink culling for starters.
11/29/2021 17:28,I refuse to call it anything other than Liverpool vs Man Utd at Old Trafford variant
11/29/2021 17:28,"Protection starts to wane almost immediately, but initially the % decrease in effectiveness is fairly small, and then each month it gets a bit less effective. That's with Delta, which has some immune evasion but not much.

I guess the fear is that Omicron is going to be much better at evading the protection incurred from the vaccines, so the more we can boost the immune response now, the more likely when/if it starts surging in a couple of months, enough protection remains to prevent severe outcomes.

I think they're finally going with the ""go hard, go early"" response to pandemics urged by the WHO. There are likely to be no downsides to topping up with boosters other than cost, but if you wait a couple of months to find out if they are necessary, you waste the time and you can't get it back. This is important because right now the UK could probably be delivering more daily boosters than it currently is: the bottleneck to delivery seems to be uptake. Increasing the pool of those eligible means more slots will be booked."
11/29/2021 17:28,"Yeah it definitely changed the equation for me. I would probably be close to back to normal now, as I’m also double vaxxed and boosted, if not for the little one. I also found out I was pregnant the week before everything shut down in the US and it was a little traumatic, not to sound dramatic. Minus going to the grocery store now and seeing vaccinated people only we are pretty much still living in March 2020 lol."
11/29/2021 17:28,"2 years ago I would have told you that becoming an NP was the greatest decision I've ever made and would have recommended that route. Now, I got nothing for you. Sorry, man. The pain is real"
11/29/2021 17:28,Can’t argue with data!
11/29/2021 17:28,"Its how viruses work, they want to spread not kill as thier priority. The vaccines are effective and will remain effective  against any variation. At worst case needing a booster."
11/29/2021 17:28,Stop being obese. Obesity is not ok.
11/29/2021 17:27,The amount of deaths due to covid with obesity as a comorbidity is the leader by far.
11/29/2021 17:27,"I remember when covid was brand new and so many people were claiming it had an incubation time of 2 weeks.

Fortunately that didn't turn out to be as common as believed, but it's very possible as there are examples of such cases out there."
11/29/2021 17:27,I should have gone there in 2019 again... now who knows if there will ever be a time again
11/29/2021 17:27,"Some got family to worry about, too. They are older, vaccinated early and not boosted."
11/29/2021 17:27,"Fully vaccinated people should not be expected to let their life pass them by in a lockdown. So many people have lost so much important time. Children have experienced record learning loss. College students have gone thousands in debt for online power points. Seniors have been unable to live the last years of their life with family. 

Enough is enough. We have vaccines. Get them."
11/29/2021 17:26,"Seems like quite alarming language, given how little we still know about this new variant."
11/29/2021 17:26,my girlfriend and I hit it raw daily but since she never takes a test she never gets pregnant
11/29/2021 17:26,"It's very, very regional.

So depending on where you live in the USA, die hard antivaxers might might \~40% of the population, or 5%.

Broken down to a demographic and local level its even more varied."
11/29/2021 17:26,And a lot of other european countries/federal states either having lockdown or planing to do it
11/29/2021 17:26,"It's not like efficacy is steady until the 6 month mark then drops off, right? We've had shitloads of breakthrough infections before the 6 month mark in the US at least."
11/29/2021 17:26,Tldr?
11/29/2021 17:26,"You do realize the animal population trumps the human population... right? 

You try playing it off of ""other"" viruses in animals... who's talking about them? We're talking about covid sars2."
11/29/2021 17:25,"I feel like one of the few that is vaccinated 3 times , still masking everywhere I go, washing my hands a lot (which I did before the pandemic) and social distancing (again which i already did)."
11/29/2021 17:25,AKA the Chelsea vs Norwich variant.
11/29/2021 17:25,Honestly nothing about this is scaring me too much right now but it will play out in the next couple weeks.  I’m triple vaxed and pretty much living life without limitations right now but if I had a young child who couldn’t get vaccinated yet I would probably feel differently.

Neither is true until we have more data.

That's incorrect. Data doesn't MAKE something true. Whatever the truth is, it's already true, and it will continue to be true, no matter how long humans take to figure it out. 

All we know now is that once we do figure it out, it's going to be better if we can look back and say we didn't need to react so strongly than to look back and say we didn't react strongly enough."

11/29/2021 17:22,"Yep, the variant-specific vaccines did not provide enough of an advantage to make the time, effort, resources, confusion of switching over worth it when the original version (particularly boosted) work very well as is.

That might change this time, but we won’t know for a bit.

As a certified guy on Reddit who reads a lot about this stuff, my armchair guess is that the current boosted vaccines will provide ample protection, particularly against severe disease and death, but another round of boosters (perhaps variant specific this time) will be recommended sometime in the first half of 2022 for at least some demographics. Other than the variant-specific part of that, that was probably already very much on the table to some extent."

Most of the studies place the estimated delays in the “few days” range and that is with a much larger travel restriction than we’re seeing here.

This one for example - which I didn’t link before - estimates a 2-3 day delay with a 40% reduction in international travel and a roughly two week delay with a 90% reduction in international travel.

11/29/2021 17:20,">Immunity most likely won’t be binary, but let’s define immunity as having a vaccine or COVID in the last 6 months.  Let’s also say effectiveness is defined at greater than 50 percent effective at reducing hospitalization or deaths.  If previous Vaccinations or infections do not reduce the risk significantly from Omicron, more than half of people vaccinated can get Onicron without effective protection.

Did you even read the comment before you got on your soap box and started preaching?  Please don't tell me what I can post and not post. You would never take this tone in person.

Yes complete antibody escape is highly unlikely, and 100 percent vaccine effectiveness is highly unlikely.

11/29/2021 17:19,"It has been around longer than the first sequencing of course (which was mid-November). But it is unlikely to have been circulating very long. The amount of drift between samples collected so far implies a common ancestor sometime in October-ish.

Plus, unlike Delta, it can be tracked by S-gene target failure on regular PCRs. If it was widespread, this S-gene target failure makes it easy to track (at least on a population basis.. not every S-gene target failure is Omicron).

It is clear that Omicron is spreading fast. It may be because it transmits faster than Delta, or it may not be any more transmissible (or in fact could be less transmissible), but it is vaccine antibody evasive that it is allowing more infections in folks that would otherwise have sterilizing immunity to Delta."

Considering the reaction to countries which discover new variants, such as UK with the Kent (Alpha) variant and now SA with Omicron, it won't surprise me in the least that going forward countries will probably stay quiet about new variants to avoid economic repercussions.

Could anyone even imagine countries like Russia or other dictatorships/authoritrian regimes admitting to having new variants in their country? They'll likely happily play ignorant.

Obviously we need data that isn't just anecdotal observations, but what we're seeing now is clearly better news than finding out that these people are being admitted to ICU a couple days after experiencing symptoms.

It probably is about in line with other variants, and possibly more like Alpha than Delta as far as severity goes. I think Beta was actually the most dangerous one so far, but it had less transmission ability than Alpha and never really got a foothold outside of South Africa."

Exponentials with a doubling time of a week or two take a while to get to really get going and overtake another variant that they are capable of out-competing. We’re still in the flat part.

Another interesting thing to note is that this mutation isn’t a child mutation off of a common variant like Delta,[it has its own genetically distinct ancestry from another variant in 2020](https://twitter.com/trvrb/status/1464353229941006336?s=21)"

Leisure, cultural and sporting events are to be banned or at least significantly restricted in Baden-Württemberg in the future. The contacts would now have to be radically reduced, said Prime Minister Winfried Kretschmann (Greens). Unfortunately, this also applies to those who have been vaccinated because the vaccination protection wears off after four to six months. The tightening should be decided tomorrow - on the basis of the Infection Protection Act.

He does not believe that the legal framework provided by the Infection Protection Act is sufficient in the fight against the pandemic , said Kretschmann. ""We need the entire instrument kit.""

In Baden-Württemberg, the 2G-plus rule already applies to all events in culture, leisure and sport . This means that so far only those who have been vaccinated and recovered have access to all events who can also show a negative test.""

""Karl Lauterbach announces closure of bars and clubs

According to the SPD health expert Karl Lauterbach, the traffic light coalition wants to tighten the corona measures in the short term. There will be proposals this week, Lauterbach announced on the Phoenix TV station. In view of the high number of infections, Lauterbach believes that bars, clubs and discos must be closed . In addition, there will probably be a mandatory mask requirement in schools as well as further restrictions for unvaccinated people. 

The background to the tightening is also the new omicron variant of the virus, which, according to Lauterbach, comes at an inopportune time. There is nothing worse than getting a more dangerous mutation during a severe wave of infection. That is why he once again strongly advocated vaccinations.""

**Obviously** people that are healthy, physically active, and in great shape are going to hold up to disease much better than those that aren't. OP is saying that if you're obese, unvaccinated, with gross hygiene... Maybe consider doing things in THIS order:

1. Get vaccinated.

In my case, i have had 3 Pfizer shots. For all i know i've never been in contact with the actual virus.

*Further analysis has shown that the people who have tested positive so far have probably contracted the virus in different places. ""In any case not during the flight,"" De Jonge writes to the Lower House.*

You aren't wrong, but you're not considering the nuances either. While they are hosted in animals, so are many other disease and those don't result in global pandemics. A virus with a pool of 50k people infected will mutate much more slowly than a virus with a pool of 500k infected.

Yes. Even if Omicron somehow 100% evades current vaccines (which won't happen), all the other variants are still out there and still infecting people.

Get vaccinated ASAP. If they aren't effective against Omicron, then there will be a booster for that variant specifically. Don't wait for the booster to come out to start the vaccination process, as you'll be unprotected entirely."

Especially when banning travel only to certain countries is at best going to buy you a couple of weeks - in a world as connected as ours, once it's detected anywhere, it's already everywhere at some level, unless the whole world goes full China and everybody shuts off from everybody else.

11/29/2021 16:38,"It's not cynical, it's a fact. There were countless articles circulating at the very beginning that discussed studies of lockdowns during the 1918 pandemic, and how they found that strict, early lockdowns did far less damage in every way than the piecemeal, half-assed approach we've done during covid.

If you actually want to be cynical, you can let this knowledge affect your view on humanity to the extent that you decide our ability to learn from the past on a societal level is an illusion. Because, with all the knowledge and experience of this exact thing occurring, as well as case studies on how to avoid it, we still took the exact same--or arguably worse--approach, which ironically led to this conversation over whether we're being cynical in thinking we should've known better. So it goes."

My parents just got to Taiwan, where it's a mandatory 14 day quarantine, regardless of vaccine status, nationality, etc. I don't think there's a test out clause. They're enjoying their big hotel room right now, with supplied meals. Hotel staff also brought in a wifi booster since the standard wifi wasn't great."

11/29/2021 16:37,There are plenty of cases of the same happening with delta.  As long as the vaccine is still preventing symptomatic and severe illness there’s no need to panic.
11/29/2021 16:37,Does anyone know if this means monoclonal antibody treatment would be ineffective?
11/29/2021 16:36,"Hopefully this means that if Omicron is spreading throughout Nigeria, the symptoms it causes are so mild that people aren't seeking out testing/going to hospital."

You're making assumptions. Yes, get vaccinated because even if Omicron evades vaccines, there are still other varients they have been proven to lessen the severity of."

11/29/2021 16:29,"Yes, all of them are double vaxxed and most are asymptomatic. The others have mild symptoms right now."
11/29/2021 16:29,"For people with no vaccine and no prior infection, Omicron has a ""control group"" that can measure its fitness as compared to Delta.

The looming question is whether existing immune cells recognize Omicron, and if so, to what degree. Also, scientists should explore whether a measurable difference exists between prior infection versus vaccination for people infected with Omicron. 

What would be helpful to know as soon as possible is whether at-home tests detect Omicron. Current advice for a testing window is only several days, based on the relatively short incubation for Delta. Omicron seems thus far to incubate for closer to 10 or 11 days rather that 4 to 5. If that holds, we could see many people assuming they're negative when really, they're a week away from a detectable viral load."
11/29/2021 16:29,"Sure, having a healthy immune system is extremely beneficial however the three I listed can be implemented immediately."
11/29/2021 16:29,"I get all that. I’m double vaccinated myself. I’m just saying that relaxing the restrictions for a milder variant, would have the effect of vaccinating those who aren’t willing to get vaccinated. Basically the whole “but ma freedums” debate could be done away with, without stepping on anyone’s toes and creating the level of civil unrest that is being seen around the globe.  
  
Tbh, the level of polarisation in society is a symptom of something much worse than covid. We’ve lived amongst viruses for the entirety of human existence, they’re as much a part of nature as we are.  
  
If you put too much evolutionary pressure on them, you might win the battle, but you’ll fare much worse in the long term war. It’s kind of similar to what we’re seeing with bacteria that are resistant to drugs.  
  
It’s silly to fight so hard against the inevitable. It’s too late to wipe out covid, so the next best scenario is basically to breed it into something as harmless as the common cold.  
  
Unfortunately, that’s not what’s happening. Necessity is the mother of all invention and we’re creating the necessity for covid to mutate for survival. Rather than putting pressure on it to mutate into something less harmful, we’re pushing it to just become more resistant to treatment.  
  
Think about it. A harmless but virulent strain, would outcompete a more harmful, but less virulent strain. Basically, as soon as one such strain is found, we need to relax restrictions more and let it continue to be dominant for as long as possible. If winning the war is impossible, then a truce is the next best thing.  
  
EDIT: omicron might not be the right strain for that. Only time will tell. I’m just saying that when the opportunity arises, we should take it. Vaccinate those that need/want to be vaccinated and pick up the rest through natural exposure to a strain that isn’t so bad."

But that's the thing, the consequences of Delta happened way faster than Beta's. I remember that in a blink of an eye there was already news about death, hospitalizations and shit going crazy in many corners of the world. I recall Delta caused it's devastation with faster methods, if Omicron is worse than the Big D (no pun intended) it will be slower but more infectious in other terms."

11/29/2021 16:26,Exactly. The time lag between when the variant begins circulating and when we catch it means it’s likely already spread. Travel restrictions just add more complications in exchange for a false sense of security.

So it really looks like they are hiding something and dripping news to not cause panic. Or they are really incompetent at policy and statement making.

They could ha e provided a much better messaging if they were consistent in their messaging and say risk is high and measures will be taken until we know more but then closing borders isn't such a measure since it is too late for that."

If you're patient you'll find flights in the $300s or less. You can subscribe to something like Scott's Cheap Flights and set up price alerts. It's only ~$50ish per year and booking just one cheap flight can pay for itself many times over. I paid $206 for a round trip Denver - Tokyo ticket this May. If it makes you feel any better my trip in February is almost certainly not going to come to fruition.
11/29/2021 16:21,"Don't throw them away just yet. We aren't positive, it's just that all these people, 60 plus of them tested ""negative"" to get on the flight and then positive when landing. The rapid tests are best when you are already symptomatic. PCR is still the ""gold standard"" but even I got the rapid test to return to work and it was correct, it was just the flu.

Then six months later you remember there was one contestant everyone forgot about.  You open the door to their kitchen, and they’ve opened a bakery.  They’re making sourdough breads that take a week to prepare.  Croissants that take three days to chill and prepare.  They’ve started brewing beer with the leftover grains and yeasts.

""None of the international cases are in serious condition, none of them are dead"", then the guy from Taiwan died, and several of the diamond princess cases started needing treatment outside the ship. Took at least a week for news to stop trying to put a positive spin on the international cases.

I remember the same thing when Delta started being reported outside of India. ""It appears to be more contagious, but less deadly than the UK variant."" Then the summer and fall waves pretty much ended the notion that we were ""done"" with Covid just because we had the vaccines.

All we know is that Omicron is more mutated than the other dominant variants, and it appears to be virulent enough to compete with Delta.

Archaeologists found the village and discovered the disease was chicken pox.  Back thousands of years ago, chicken pox with a terrifying disease with a near 100% mortality rate.  But after several thousands of years of co-evolution, it's mainly a childhood illness no more dangerous to us than a typical flu virus.

You're right with a low amount of cases it wouldn't be noticeable, but I reckon the amount of cases isn't low. We're seing loads of countries finding it, Belgium, Canada, Scotland, Holland.

There wouldn't be that many countries receiving it with a very low number of cases in SA I reckon.

11/29/2021 15:48,"On the virulence question. I had to take off an article because the bot said it was inappropriate...although it let it through first time... 

**The virulence question and MORE enhanced transmission discussion.**  
  
This article was written in like February of 2020. Remember our halcyon days of denial? https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-0690-4  
  
It discusses both tranmission and virulence as a function of mutations. If you really want to drill down, the references are a good place to start.  
  
From this, and the above, there is another ""twist"" in transmission dynamics. I remember reading about this years ago, and the article above provides context on it, but this is the first comment on it below (with as yet no proof).  
  
URL triggered mode delete... But here are the questions. 

Question: What if a virus mutates to such a degree that it ends up harming its viability in the whole?  
  
Remember SARS? It appeared to be evolving toward something that makes Covid19 look like a cake walk. What happened to it? We don't know for sure and the extreme Community Containment response may have helped, but...something changed. MERS? seemingly scary potential. All three of these ""recent"" variants on Coronaviruses have zoonotic origins. SARS and MERS for whatever reasons never took off in the human population although SARS made a run for it. I doubt personally it was anything humans did that stop them. So, it was likely in their genes. Covid19? Well, it appears to have what it takes to jump species and ""stick"" like the other Coronaviruses we presently live with quite easily... https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/coronaviruses  
  
So what does all this mean?  
  
The above linked article (newshub) asks the question, did mutations stop a country level outbreak of Covid? Maybe?  
  
Conclusion? It is way too early to panic on the new variant that everyone appears to be panicking about. It, more than likely, will be another variation on the theme we should be getting used to. Worst case, imho, it may spread like Delta has providing another opportunity for unvaccinated individuals to get sick and/or die while the vaccinated and previously vaccinated have substantially better outcomes irrespective of vaccination or previous infections. It could have slightly different clinical characteristics potentially impacting different sub-populations (age?) but overall, just another wave on the sea of Covid gradually getting smaller and smaller like any ripples on a pond over time where inputs decline and in the case of Covid the reservoir becomes less naive from many standpoints.  
  
As I stated in February 2020 on Reddit. When the first General Epi data came out from China on Covid I breathed a sigh of relief. Up until then I too was wondering if this was the Zombie Apocolypse. Those data (I was the first to post) made me realize and I stated it then, nope, it's going to be the flu from hell. And I was right. https://www.greatfallstribune.com/story/news/2020/03/28/montana-zombie-apocalypse-flu-hell/2932917001/  
  
Oh and the best evidence of the long term outcomes of Covid at a population level? (long term meaning centuries and millenia...) Well, here are the other Coronaviruses humanity deals with. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/general-information.html In the present day, they are primarily a pain in the ass and not viral killing machines. What were they when first introduced into the human species? Your guess is as good as mine, but I bet the similarities to Covid are much more similar than not."

""There are signs within South Africa that while this variant is highly prevalent in spread, to this point, they have not seen a hospitalization spike, and in fact, they haven't gotten as many symptomatic cases as they expected.

Edit: to avoid confusion, I don’t mean Zero COVID should be scattered at the beginning, just that if one cannot maintain it without sacrificing some people to a extreme extent, stepping back a bit should be considered."

Amazing how scientists can't explain this to folks.

Getting some downvotes done maybe I need to explain

If Immunity is shared between Delta and Omicron, it is a race.  

But if immunity is not shared, they will coexist without competing against each other.  

Immunity most likely won’t be binary, but let’s define immunity as having a vaccine or COVID in the last 6 months.  Let’s also say effectiveness is defined at greater than 50 percent effective at reducing hospitalization or deaths.  If previous Vaccinations or infections do not reduce the risk significantly from Omicron, more than half of people vaccinated can get Onicron without effective protection."

It also matters whether the original vaccines/antibodies are effective, if they are it would take even longer to see a spike.

It's going to take a few weeks to figure this out unfortunately. Only thing we can do is hope for the best and prepare for the worst."

I can see how they came to the conclusion. In a deleted comment, they noted that most European nations are part of the European continent, and thus the only country with a comparable size is the UK….

11/29/2021 15:35,">  I’m only bringing up this theory because Holland/Belgium/Germany is having the worst outbreak worldwide at the moment so the potential for variants would seem to be very high there.

I know you're getting downvoted to hell, but that's a reasonable inference to draw. Luckily for us, this particular variant gives us an insanely easy way to track it, and we can use that method to disprove your theory.  

When someone takes a PCR Covid test, the test looks for 3 specific genes in the sample.  With all the currently circulating variants, all 3 of those genes are detected.  With Omicron, only 2 of them are.  The third one comes up a blank.  (source, third paragraph - https://www.who.int/news/item/26-11-2021-classification-of-omicron-(b.1.1.529)-sars-cov-2-variant-of-concern)  Of course we still need to send it out for genetic testing to be absolutely 100% sure, but this makes it ridiculously easy to tell at a glance which cases are very likely to be Omicron, and which are very unlikely to be so.

Given that information, assorted governments and scientific communities have searched through their recent positive PCR tests, looking for signs of Omicron.  If your theory was correct and the new variant was driving the current surge, they'd be finding tests with 2 out of 3 genes showing EVERYWHERE.  They aren't.  They're finding one or two tests with that sign, all recently, and almost all in people who recently traveled from southern Africa.

So yes, it is a reasonable assumption and was absolutely worth checking into, but the evidence doesn't bear it out.  Omicron is not driving the recent surge in central and eastern Europe."

Honestly, just looking at the cases *from* Africa and how far its spread across Africa already, logic dictates it’s been spreading everywhere for awhile. And it likely didn’t start where the first outbreak was recognized.

As far as I know, there's little variant-specific testing which happens where most people get tested. I am under the impression that once a sample has been flagged as ""covid present"" some fraction of them are sent to a bigger lab to be sequenced to determine the variant then, by the wonder of prob/stats, they determine how many samples probably had that variant.

I could never not travel, I could never not gather with friends and any limitation to only going to the grocery store, for which there where never any lines, was self restricted when it first started. For fucks sake my gym in SC didn’t close until May and my gym in DC was reopened by August 2020."

11/29/2021 15:03,"that would depend on how much less severe it is i guess. For example if its twice as contagious as Delta but slightly less severe than Delta then we wouldnt exactly be in a great situation since it would end up sending more people into hospital than Delta since being slightly less severe wont help much if it spreads far more easily.

But lets say its twice as contagious and much much less severe then sure it could probably work in our favour.  

Another key bit will also be protection from vaccines and prior infection. if vaccines etc can still at least protect us against severe disease then this will help us tremendously since at least then we know we have some line of defence to rely on."

11/29/2021 14:54,"I think that's mostly wishful thinking at the moment. COVID becomes transmittable before a person is symptomatic, so the virus doesn't really have much evolutionary pressure to become less severe. 

So far it seems more young people can get affected by Omicron, which would mean higher percentages of people ending up in the hospital. Even if it is less severe, if more transmissible it will likely pack hospitals better than Delta, and that in itself will lead to deaths or a greatly reduced quality of life for many people (at least for some time). Furthermore it will likely put immense strain on the US insurance system, given the exorbitant cost of hospital stays.

Then there are the economic implications. Businesses have just started to bounce back in some places, but this will likely deter patrons, partly also due to the media hysteria. Winter time is also notoriously bad for viruses. Likely this will lead to more confusion around anticipating consumer demand, and screw up supply chains all over again (they are already terrible, not just for consumer goods, but also for companies in machine manufacturing, high tech, and other industries)

I also expect implications for vaccine hesitancy. The booster shot was not fun (for me), and I know people who support vaccination who have been hesitant to get it due to the awful side effects that can last days. The picture that is emerging is that we will need boosters every X months, and some people won't be willing to go a long with that. For many, they barely agreed to get 2 shots, now you'd be asking them to get one on a reoccurring basis. And yes, the virus is undoubtedly far worse than any reoccurring need for vaccination, however fatigue and mental trauma caused by this whole ordeal hasn't exactly made people think clearly. Couple with that the absolutely insane politics in the US, where one party (in a 2 party system) has effectively taken up the anti-vaccine mantle, and you have a recipe for disaster.

Does it make me furious that people don't want to take vaccines and believe in BS conspiracy theories? Yes - they are literally participating in killing off their fellow countryfolk through ignorance and stubbornness, also damaging the economy and causing economic impact that will be felt for many years to come. Furthermore, wealthy western nations need to do a lot more in terms of making the vaccine available globally, including opening up the patents, I think the CEOs of Pfiser and Moderna have enough billions by now to afford their nth yacht or mansion."
11/29/2021 14:54,"This is insanity

Not only from a stop the spread perspective

But these planes are the best chance to understand the severity of omicron . We have a very controlled group, we can see how much the variant spreads by testing everyone, by testing multiple times we can see the incubation period, we can look at the percent vaxxed that tested positive , and we can follow this group to see what the hospitalization numbers look like

Honestly this is a huge mistake and the people at the cdc should be fired over this"

Not true. I know multiple of young adult men who got Pfizer or Moderna.

I can imagine them giving Jansen to football players to get them vaccinated faster. But, for the general public, by the time vaccines opened to young adults, I believe they mostly used Jansen on men who waited until their age group no longer needed advance booking."

You presented it as if the whole of the uk was cut off from France and by extension the EU. It simply wasn’t. It was 48 hours for some truckers. Most other eu countries has no full travel bans. 

If you want to talk about the risks I would say having new cases being reported being generally above 30k new cases a day, for months is a massive risk to generating new
mutations. So personally I would say the situation is far worse in the UK than it is in SA. 
 

Also ofcourse we are going to have 400% increases but this is the start of our 6 month cycle next wave. 
We’re at the bottom of our wave. And cases have been low for months. So our actual movement have been 2k ish new cases the last couple days. Compare that to the UKs over 30k new cases every day since July. Or since you like precision then 7th of July. Also, since you like percentages that’s 1500%. Every single day. Since July. The UK has been a new variant factory for months. Where are these effective travel bans for this rogue nation?

And our increased cases figure isn’t directly attributable to the new variant either, or atleast this isn’t truly demonstrable. It is also due to year end functions and parties of the school going ages for year end among other things.  But attribute it all to some boogie man of the omicron variant if you wish."

How many cases do we have now? How many people were dying of Delta in the early stages? Delta didn't start being a problem in India until March. I remember initially there were speculations of it infecting younger people more frequently and causing unusual but milder symptoms such as a runny nose. Plus waves typically start off in younger people before spreading to the elderly, so it'd be only normal that no one has died so far.

>a virus mutating into something less deadly but more contagious is the path of least resistance and most likely path for a virus

The four nations of the United Kingdom have all restricted travel to southern Africa, where the variant was first detected last week, in a bid to slow its spread.

But Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said not all of the six cases had recent travel history or known links with others who had travelled to southern Africa.

""This suggests that there might already be some community transmission of this variant,"" she told a news conference.
""There is no evidence yet that this is sustained, nor any evidence from the enhanced surveillance that it is widespread at this stage.""

Sturgeon said the timeframe of the cases suggested it was unlikely but not impossible that there was a link to the COP26 climate change conference that took place in Glasgow earlier this month.
COMING HOURS

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has responded to the emergence of Omicron by making mask-wearing compulsory in shops and on public transport in England.
He also asked the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) to review the booster programme for under-40s, and look at reducing the gap between second and third vaccine doses.

""We'd expect that (review) within the coming hours,"" junior health minister Edward Argar told Sky News.
Ministers and scientists say even if vaccines prove to be less effective against Omicron, they should still offer protection against it and help keep a lid on numbers of hospitalisations and deaths.

Anthony Harnden, deputy chair of the JCVI, said that given it would take time to develop a variant-specific vaccine, raising immunity in the population was advisable.
""Inevitably, everybody will be offered a booster, but what we want to do is make sure that it's done in a sensible order,"" he told BBC TV.


Scientists say Omicron has about double the number of mutations to the spike protein as the currently dominant Delta variant.
Argar said that cases would inevitably rise further, but ""we don't know by what speed or by what numbers ...We're trying to give ourselves the time to understand how it works and how it interacts with the vaccine."""

In all fairness though this thing is moving pretty fast. I'm not so much worried about severe illness (myself and my close contacts are all 2xvacc) but the ripple effects to businesses whether supply chain issues, staffing, or potentially reinstated physical restrictions could be just as devastated as the health sector."

""The Japanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida, said that Japan would reverse a move earlier this month to reopen its borders to short-term business travelers and international students. Japan, the world’s third-largest economy, has been closed to tourists since early in the pandemic, a policy it has maintained even as other wealthy nations reopened to vaccinated visitors.""

11/29/2021 14:29,"Well claiming the peak was when cases were almost 50% lower is not splitting hairs as that's a major difference. You were also quite misinformed about the French travel ban.

Except it clearly does because despite whatever the EU recommended travel bans were instated. You're currently trying to make claims about the entire western world based on two different recommendations from the EU commission, one of which was widely ignored. 

'Now you are changing the argument to the situation in SA being bad. But then the next breath you say the situation in the EU being at peak had nothing to do with the UK issuing no travel bans but all to do with new variants. Pick one opposing viewpoint please.'

No, the new variant is still the main cause, however, as I clearly said it's not the only concern in response to you looking at number of cases alone. A new variant causing cases to increase by 400% in a week is potentially far more dangerous than one causing cases to increase by 11% in a week. That's not obfuscating, that's understanding nuance and that this situation is far more complex than you seem to understand (or want to understand to support whatever racism claim you are making)

No I never said anything about the 'EU being at peak' so I have no idea what you are referring to. I said that a new variant spreading in the UK would lead (and did lead) to EU countries implementing travel bans, but as the new variant was in the UK and not in the EU there would be no benefit to the UK implementing it's own travel bans. When the EU did get new variants new restrictions were implemented such as with France in July 2021 due to Beta variant. Travel bans are used to stop a new variant spreading out of a particular area so I'm not sure why you think they would be implemented against an area without that variant.

Whether they work or not is a different point entirely. You were claiming they were unfairly targeting SA which they clearly are not because most countries with a new variant have had increased restrictions or travel ban."
11/29/2021 14:29,"""Some border areas"" being a few relatively small cities, like Ruili. This affects what percent of the Chinese population?

It shouldn't be forbidden to think that other measures could be used, but you can count the number of countries that have handled the pandemic over the last year+ as well as China on one hand. Looking around the world, I don't see any other model that performs as well, both in terms of deaths and in terms of maintaining normalcy in everyday life."
11/29/2021 14:28,This is a question I would love an answer to. And should be answerable with current samples. We have other variants with similar RBD mutations that infected vaccinated people. We should be able to see if they've generated novel antibodies in response to the mutant infection.

New variant may infect more and kill less, experts say
None November 29, 2021

The large amount of Ômicron mutations is an unusual fact that needs to be investigated in Brazil, say scientists consulted by Estadão. Discovered in South Africa, the new variant of the coronavirus has 50 mutations. About 30 are located in the so-called spike protein, the one that allows the virus to enter human cells and is one of the main targets of vaccines against covid-19.

Ômicron variant is confirmed on four continents; Austria and Brazil study suspected cases
Ômicron variant is confirmed on four continents; Austria and Brazil study suspected cases

A first hypothesis for the occurrence of so many mutations (three times more than what was seen in the Delta variant) is that it developed in an immunocompromised patient who harbored the Alpha variant for a long time in South Africa. The tests detect the Ômicron because it does not have a specific gene – the same as Alpha, according to international experts. “We had never seen a variant with so many mutations”, says professor Amilcar Tanuri, coordinator of the Virology Laboratory at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ).

Tanuri says he supports the hypothesis that emerging viruses tend to attenuate as they spread through the human population. With each mutation, the tendency is for them to become more transmissible and less lethal.

The first reports from doctors in South Africa indicate that the virus spreads rapidly, but without a large number of serious cases. “This observation in South Africa is still empirical, but it corroborates the hypothesis of attenuation of the virus and increase in transmissibility”, says the coordinator of the UFRJ.

“In Brazil, we still haven't had access to the Ômicron variant to study it”, says Tanuri. “As soon as it is detected in the country, the first thing to be done is to isolate the virus and put it in contact with the serum of patients vaccinated here in Brazil and also infected with the Delta variant”, says the virologist.

In this way, it will be possible to know whether having overcome other coronaviruses confers some immunity (cross-protection) against Ômicron. The second question that will need to be answered is how the new variant will behave. In other words: if it is going to replace Delta in Brazil, as it seems to be doing in Africa. As the virus can be transmitted faster than the competitor, it wins the dispute. The former continues to circulate, but to a lesser extent. It is worth remembering that Delta ended up not causing an increase in cases in Brazil – according to many experts, because of a combination of vaccination and sanitary measures.

According to Tanuri, several groups have published the sequencing of viruses found in people who have had persistent or prolonged infection with the previous variants. In a study carried out at UFRJ with two dozen of these patients, the researchers observed that the accumulation of mutations in the spike protein is proportional to the time the virus remains in the individual.

For epidemiology Cesar Victora, professor emeritus at the Federal University of Pelotas (UFPel), the reports from doctors in South Africa may be a sign that the coronavirus is evolving like many other viruses that are very aggressive at first, but become attenuated with time. “This could be happening, which would be good news, but it's too early to know,” he says.

The specialist believes that the country needs to expand its variant monitoring system. “We have to increase capacity. We've still done little sequencing. The variant may already be here and not yet discovered”, says the coordinator of the scientific committee of Instituto Todos Pela Saúde."

11/30/2021 15:51,"It just happens to have mutations found in several other unrelated Greek letter variants, but it's not closely related to anything we know of."
11/30/2021 15:51,"I don't think the vaccine efficacy discussion is jumping the gun, at least in terms of sterilizing immunity. We already know that Beta did strongly impact protection from infection, and to a much lesser extent severe disease. An oversimplification obviously, but Omicron has the same E484 mutation as Beta, plus most of the features that made Delta more transmissible, plus a few other mutations that may or may not impact immune evasion or transmissibility. 

I mean, I get that we need to be data driven and not jump the gun with speculation. For example, we have no theoretical basis to know whether or not Omicron will result in more or less severe infections. It's just not something we can effectively model. We also don't have as much steer on how cell-mediated immune response will be impacted by Omicron because simulating that is far more complex - it may not be impacted much at all, it may be impacted some (somewhat likely), or (extremely unlikely), it may be highly impacted. 

But we *do* know how antibodies bind, and we *do* know what antibodies are statistically most commonly produced as a result of the vaccines in terms of preferential binding sites. We *know* some of those sites are impacted by the mutations, and have already seen the impact of at least one of those mutations on antibody effectiveness (in Beta) and so it is not just a theoretical simulation of protein site bonding that we're relying on. 

I don't think it is jumping the gun to say ""It will almost certainly impact vaccine efficacy from infection, but we need data to confirm. It may or may not impact protection from severe disease, and we also don't know whether Omicron leads to more severe or less severe disease on average. More research is needed there.""

At some point, you have to trust theoretical predictions based on overwhelming evidence. While obviously a different category of predictive power, you wouldn't ask for data on whether a bowling ball will fall if you drop it because you only tested an apple and you need the data to prove it. 

In a fast-moving environment, you have to give some weight high-confidence predictions. For example, the delayed second dose strategy employed by some countries. We didn't have the data, but we knew it wouldn't impact efficacy (if anything, we know it would impact it positively.. which ended up being the case)."

11/30/2021 15:49,"It doesn't really matter for their bottom line since they sound fairly confident that they can update the vaccine quickly. Yearly COVID shots, just like flu shots, are probably becoming a thing too. That would probably be even better for the future of the company.

11/30/2021 15:44,"> That’s just more work and more research, and might not even pan out.

Not really.  These vaccines are trivial to update (both Moderna and Pfizer also made beta and delta versions, but didn't mass produce because they weren't needed).

It is essentially guaranteed to ""pan out"" and most of the work surrounds regulatory approvals, as the FDA hasn't fully defined their process for this yet."

Mosh Pits, Orgies, licking toilet seats,  it's all good, they did their part already!

This guy has probably ""had COVID"" 4 times and spread it without other people even noticing, which is part of the irony/danger of this whole thing.  It seems extremely hard on those who are already ""weak,"" and young healthy folks might not even notice it. 

A persistent similar example of what is happening during COVID is how may people STILL try to share drinks and food while they have active cold sores(and many accept completely unaware), because they fundamentally don't want to understand that they have herpes, or admit what's going on."
11/30/2021 15:43,"WHO also advocated for a booster moratorium before the holidays and winter in the US.

They are not always giving advice that optimizes any particular individual's health.

Minimizing Omicron cases while the world figures out how deadly it is, is probably the best course of action for everyone that isn't southern africa.

While case rate is small, minimizing importing new cases is actually really beneficial."
11/30/2021 15:43,"Take it with a grain of salt, because most of the early cases were detected in college kids, where you would expect mild cases anyway."
11/30/2021 15:43,"I think this is what a lot of people are missing. Lots of folks act like a lockdown should be this thing that we all just do and it's no big deal and life goes on.

My honor student failed multiple classes last year. The scars of lockdown can be seen as you drive around town and spot the corpses of small businesses that couldn't ride out the lost customers. The global logistics network is so thoroughly wrecked we have an ""everything"" shortage. The government had to pump truckloads of free money into people's pockets to keep them afloat, and now we're staring down the barrel of inflation not seen since the 70s. The list goes on.

What would another lockdown give us? I'm not ready to find out. I did my part, and my part ended when we were all vaccinated in my family. My heart goes out to those people who are still in danger, it really does, but the well being of my family (to include their mental and emotional health) is always going to trump yours no matter how hard I try to rationalize it. And the reality is that, on a basic human instinct level, most people feel that way, too.

Edit: I feel like this is important to say... if I'm asked to wear a mask I still will because I'm not a man child and it does not harm me or anyone else in the slightest. A mask is not a lockdown."

11/30/2021 15:42,"I just happened to catch a bit of the Parlimentary debate that’s going on. Apparently the Labour cabinet were having a party yesterday evening within Westminster, not a mask to be seen. 

When challenged on it the shadow minister replied with some quip about the Tory MP snitching on him not being invited to the party. And the questioner, after being very fiery with his question, had a good laugh at the answer as well. 

I think it’s a bit shitty that this is what passes for government (and both sides are absolutely guilty of it): if you’ve got a witty quip, the other side’s allegation is apparently sufficiently addressed and that’s the end of it. Jacob Rees Mogg does it all the time. 

I think the speaker should hold them to task and ensure difficult questions are answered."

11/30/2021 15:41,"I obviously don't know what you've already gone through with your wife, so I apologize if I'm being redundant. You say she's afraid of mRNA vaccines specifically. Would J&J, a viral vector vaccine, be an option?

If she's not afraid of COVID, could you offer the framing that, in effect, the vaccine *is* COVID? The virus itself contains the exact same RNA, and it also gets the RNA into your cells to make your cells make the spike protein. It just also contains other RNA to make the rest of the virus too. The vaccine does the exact same thing as the virus, except with the part to make more virus taken out. The vaccine is literally just a carefully selected subset of a regular COVID infection, so anyone who's not afraid of COVID has nothing to fear from the vaccine."

So I put off signing up for the booster until it had a positive recommendation from the CDC or from my doctor - who I visited yesterday and got that positive recommendation, which now seems redundant."

11/30/2021 15:39,"I would assume most do, since it’s statistically more likely for an unvaccinated person to get infected. You need to have a larger scale infection for a virus to multiply enough to mutate. Then that mutation needs its host to be contagious. Unvaccinated people are also way more likely to be contagious.

Plus if it did originate in Africa, Africa is way less vaccinated than the rest of the world.

So I assume it would be more likely. Viruses aren’t sentient and can’t really change purposefully to infect someone who is vaccinated and mounting an immune response."

In the 18 - 59 age group almost half of new symptomatic cases are in fully vaccinated people, almost 30% of people requiring hospitalization are fully vaccinated in that age group.  In the above 60 age group the numbers are about 70% and 55% respectively.  Almost 50% of people requiring intensive care above 60 are fully vaccinated as well."
11/30/2021 15:39,"That's definitively *not* what they said.

The vaccine efficacy is almost certainly going to be reduced.

Right now, the efficacy is 95%+.  Pfizer's CEO said that he would be surprised if it dropped below 70%.  That's a huge drop, but it is more-or-less a ""worst case"" and it still doesn't put us back to square one.

In addition (and not directly to your point, but related to whether it will be safe to have a ""normal"" holiday season), we are about to have an antiviral with 90% efficacy.  This doesn't target the spike protein and there is basically no concern it won't work.  What we need to do is get people access to affordable testing before and after the holidays.  (Before to reduce spread, and after to catch infections early enough for the antiviral to be effective)."
11/30/2021 15:39," Outside of arm soreness, which is a side effect of any injection, all of the vaccine side effects are also side effects of covid.  And *far* more common with covid than with vaccines.

Been keeping an eye on the data and it seems that if you’re vaccinated, omicron won’t give you a serious case. If omicron was lethal even with a vaccine, then yes, let’s lock down. Other than that, no way. Good luck enforcing it here in the US because at least 40% of the population is going to fight or tooth and nail."

Beta, and now potentially Omicron, were both likely tailored to evade vaccine or prior infection induced immunity within an immunocompromised individual. There are over 10 million such individuals in southern Africa, over 7 million of which reside in South Africa alone. Countries with high HIV prevalence have been targeted by these restrictions, this is not a coincidence.

You couldn’t find that many severely immunocompromised individuals in the entire Western Hemisphere and Europe combined.

Next time the world should do a better job getting shots into the arms of immunocompromised individuals, but vaccine hesitancy will likely still be a global problem, as it was this time around in South Africa."

Travel bans are just a show-off of ""lookie-lou how seriously we are taking these new variants!"" They do not prevent the new variant from spreading around the world, and I am dubious whether they even slow down the spread of new variants by any practical amount.

Travel bans are just some corny flexing in my view."

Please, be polite and factual, **do not suggest divorce**, this is not an option. Sometimes good people make bad choices. We all make mistakes and have our own biases and (sometimes false) believes.

I tried to create a post on r/askreddit and on r/advice but this question is not allowed there. I have read the Vaccine FAQ in this post but it seems to be outdated, e.g. it says ""mRNA vaccine are yet to be approved by the FDA for use in humans"" which is not true anymore, right?"

I genuinely wonder how long it's been around, and what kind of pressure it's facing from Delta. We're still not hearing about a substantial number of total cases, I wonder if it'll even be capable of becoming the dominant strain. And that also leads into the question of whether we would stand to benefit or not from it being dominant, if it does indeed prove to be less severe. We really need some more data about this one so that we can prepare appropriately."
11/30/2021 15:22,"We know the current wave is Delta, see https://covariants.org/per-country

What I find interesting is that many of the same people who are usually very skeptical of big corporations now just blindly believe everything they’re telling the general public about Covid.

So wouldn’t it make more sense to wait for the new vaccine rather than getting a booster for the old vaccine?"
11/30/2021 15:13,"You need to compare age groups. 13% of hospitalisations being fully vaxed is not necessarily bad even if only 25% of total pop is vaccinated.

I was looking at the latest UK numbers and vaxed fatalities stood out a lot, it looks like vaxed had overall higher chance of death then unvaxed. The study had 1000 vaxed and 1000 unvaxed samples, 50 dead in the vaxed group and only 20 in the unvaxed.  Vaccines don’t work and actually make you worse off?? Nah , the vaxxed sample was on average 30 years older then unvaxed sample. 

Remember that even if vax is 90% effective in any age group, the CFR is pretty much exponential with age. I.e. a fully vaxxed 70 year old still has bigger risk dying from Covid then a unvaxed 30 year old. 

These numbers look nowhere worse then delta so far in terms of hospitalisation and deaths, but lets see more data."

eta: I don’t think it’s necessarily evil and nefarious, more so they and their inter/national advisors know how bad it’s going to affect the willingly unvaxxed until they see it firsthand. Anything otherwise may descend into immediate anti-restriction riots.

I’m worried for health care workers *and* infrastructure that are all still recuperating, in supplies and in staff.

I’m a sociology nerd, so I have a pretty cynical outlook on federal governments insofar as their covert preparational motives."
11/30/2021 15:07,"Wait this quote fucking confused me as there’s two different stories.

Story one: there’s been an uptick of increases from Gauteng.

Story two: we have been tracking this since February. 

So her final quote isn’t for the omicron variant but for delta as well. 

I also note that 87% of all admissions in Pretoria were unvaccinated. Was this prior to, or before the omicron addition?"

11/30/2021 15:06,"You can prevent (bad) infections quite easily by vaccinating people, wearing masks in enclosed public areas and not allowing unvaxxed people to have wild 200k+ people concerts as super spreader events.  The government has chosen not to do these things and thus we have overrun hospitals and burnt out health care workers and a whole society who has decided that laws and mandates and common decency don’t apply to them.  The results of which we are already seeing in medical care staff opting out and people forming flash mobs to rob stores - after all if enough people decide to break a law at once the authorities will literally do nothing."

11/30/2021 15:05,"No, this will not impact your ability to get an omicron or any other booster.

Nothing of the vaccine is left active after a week. Its fat, mRNA, salt and a pinch of sugar. Your body degrades it all rapidly."

11/30/2021 15:03,"The problem is that increasing healthcare capacity is a slow, multi-year process. Limited resources in all levels of healthcare are almost always about staffing and very rarely about literal beds or physical spaces. 

On top of that, you're never going to get healthcare to the point where you can just weather a pandemic without restrictions. That would require staffing ICUs at 200+% capacity, which is never going to survive long in either a public or private system (in a public system, it's a juicy target for opposing parties to talk about how wasteful the government in power is, and in a private system, lol at the idea of any private business paying double staff costs just in case another pandemic happens)."
11/30/2021 15:03,Sure. I wonder if any travel restrictions will attenuate spread given the presence already.
11/30/2021 15:03,"Because it was determined the current sequence covered delta adequately enough. The hope being the larger spacing of time between initial series and booster will lead to longer lasting immunity at titer levels high enough to still keep Delta infections to a low.

Now the testing is being done in a lab to see if omicron will behave similarly, or if they'll need to change the sequence."

11/30/2021 15:01,"If current boosters lack protection against Omicron then there might be more harm in getting them. Because you will not be able to get Omicron booster once its released as not sufficient time will have passed. There needs to be 6-8 months between vaccines, right?

Ok, so you get booster now and then 4 months later they say it sucks and you need Omicron booster now. But you can't get Omicron booster, because too little time has passed. What now?"
11/30/2021 15:01,All these Transformersy names. Confusing.
11/30/2021 15:01,"Even if Omicron only causes the sniffles, it should still be considered dangerous because we don’t know what the long Covid statistics will be like from it. I’ve had chronic fatigue syndrome for over 20 years and can say with confidence that these post-viral fatiguing illnesses are nothing to f around with. They can leave you pretty seriously disabled. We don’t know yet if the long haulers are going to recover. It’s better to err on the side of safety."

11/30/2021 14:59,gotta love that unneeded sinophobia
11/30/2021 14:59,"Yes, you could expect it to decrease severely. Since most data so far is from SA and many people are not vaccinated there though we don't know. It's also possible that healthy immune system would still recognize the virus as a threat either through the spike protein or as you said maybe our T cells. All hard to say, and at the current time IMO it's best to practice as much caution as possible while not totally freaking out because this is just one in a long line of mutations, and it will mutate again after this.

Edit: pre coffee grammatical nonsense OMG."
11/30/2021 14:59,"Do you know how long it would take to train the people to staff those hospitals? And what happens when coronavirus is over and all those people and hospitals get forgotten again?

11/30/2021 14:57,"Abstract  
Determination of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses in the context of pre-existing immunity to circulating human coronavirus (HCoV) is critical for understanding protective immunity. Here we perform a multifactorial analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV antibody responses in pre-pandemic (N = 825) and SARS-CoV-2-infected donors (N = 389) using a custom-designed multiplex ABCORA assay. ABCORA seroprofiling, when combined with computational modeling, enables accurate definition of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion and prediction of neutralization activity, and reveals intriguing interrelations with HCoV immunity. Specifically, higher HCoV antibody levels in SARS-CoV-2-negative donors suggest that pre-existing HCoV immunity may provide protection against SARS-CoV-2 acquisition. In those infected, higher HCoV activity is associated with elevated SARS-CoV-2 responses, indicating cross-stimulation. Most importantly, HCoV immunity may impact disease severity, as patients with high HCoV reactivity are less likely to require hospitalization. Collectively, our results suggest that HCoV immunity may promote rapid development of SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity, thereby underscoring the importance of exploring cross-protective responses for comprehensive coronavirus prevention."
11/30/2021 14:57,"Yeah I'd be interested to know if one-dose is part of that 13% that are considered vaccinated. The news is already good, but it'd be even better if so."
11/30/2021 14:57,"About 43% received J&J single dose vaccination in South Africa, so not necessarily, the overall  vaccination rate should be more than 30%."

11/30/2021 14:55,So we know now that the current vaccines are effective against Omikron? I seem to have missed the publication of study results...
11/30/2021 14:55,"100% agree with the effectiveness of many travel restrictions, including entry quarantines, testing, and contact tracing. Those things have always been known to work. It's what WHO and others have been advocating for over the last few decades. 

What I was discussing earlier were country/region specific travel bans like we're seeing with southern Africa. Those measures, banning direct flights from those countries, are not effective and do more harm than good. Particularly when it comes to disease surveillance and contact tracing, and disease identification. If you incentivize countries and individuals to hide information, like where individuals have travelled to or new diseases/variants identified by national governments, you undercut your surveillance and tracing measures."
11/30/2021 14:54,I'm not sure that's right. According to [SA government dashboard](https://sacoronavirus.co.za/latest-vaccine-statistics/) (see page 12) Gauteng is at only 31% fully vaccinated compared to 35% for SA as a whole.
11/30/2021 14:54,There's a free way to reduce hospitalisation by 2/3rd for many people but people are too selfish to do it.
11/30/2021 14:54,"Got the smallpox at SRP, moved to the next table for Anthrax. They said it was optional, so I passed on that one.  I’d just heard horror stories of the old batches from the 90’s and didn’t want to deal with it when we were about to ship out, even though by that point I think they were using a different formula that didn’t have those issues.

And it's for a good reason. New information dictates new measures, but there will ALWAYS be holdouts and they will ALWAYS reset the progress. I'd love to have a vaccine mandate for adults in the US but despite that desire I know that it's in no way legal. All we can do is strongly incentivize people to get their vaccines (negative and positive incentives). 

But even we did, the world doesn't revolve around us and others elsewhere in the world will put us in the same situation. Vaccination is the only realistic countermeasure and now that we have it, we have to accept as a society that the world is a dangerous place, and it's a little more dangerous today than it was a couple years ago.

Absolutely true, but the vaccine isn't even a light dose of the virus. Pfizer and Moderna vaccines contain the RNA of the spike protein, and the J&J vaccine uses a harmless adenovirus as a vector.

The reaction you get to the vaccine is your own immune system getting ready to fight something. It would feel a lot worse if there would be something to fight."

I don’t care if I look crazy. I’m vaccinated, but I’m still afraid of long Covid. Even if omicron only produces the sniffles in 100% of people, and no deaths, I’m still not letting my guard down when it comes to town because we won’t know the long Covid statistics. I have had chronic fatigue syndrome for over 20 years and it’s very disabling and cost me my career.

11/30/2021 14:33,">  the theory that it was the variant currently driving the surge in Europe which is likely still delta dominate?

The theory that the current wave was driven by Omicron never made much sense. While not all countries do the same level of sequencing, all western countries do more than enough to determine which variants are dominant. Determining the prevalence of different variants to within 1% accuracy is well within the possibilities of all countries in western Europe. If something other than Delta had become an important factor, we would've known it well before it started to meaningfully impact case growth. So the current peak is all Delta.

What the discovery of Omicron in samples from before the travel ban shows is mostly that travel bans aren't effective in keeping a new variant out. They may slow down the spread of it by a little bit, but this virus is too slippery to contain with reactive travel bans. If you want to keep it out, you need to quarantine everyone entering the country."

11/30/2021 14:30,"It's true that the general consensus pre-CoVID was that travel restrictions would be ineffective against a highly transmissible respiratory virus.

However, during this pandemic, travel restrictions, in combination with very good contact tracing, mass testing and localized lockdowns, have worked in several countries to maintain essentially zero CoVID-19.

Travel restrictions (such as quarantine on entry) can drastically reduce the number of imported cases. If you do nothing else, it doesn't matter in the long run, because the few cases that do slip through grow into self-perpetuating outbreaks. But if you have very good contact tracing behind the quarantine barrier, you can put out the small fires as they pop up.

That's what mainland China and Taiwan are doing right now, and what Australia, New Zealand and Vietnam did for more than a year. What most countries are doing right now will only delay Omicron by a tiny bit. But mainland China and Taiwan will prevent Omicron from establishing any foothold at all if they continue their current policies."

The only reason we don't have a vaccine for them is that nobody bothers to invest, as the risk thoses viruses pose is too small.  In vet medicine certain coronaviruses are quite dangerous and we do have vaccines for them, they were the reason we got the fast vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 in the first place.

But most experts anticipated that there wouldn't be any significant mutation drive in COVID, just like in the common cold Corona viruses, which don't mutate at all.

It is not impossible that we come to a point where vaccines will be more or less pointless as a mean of reducing spread because of all the different variants going round.

China is the 2nd largest donor of vaccines. It has donated over 100 million doses so far.

> Even Covax had to buy Chinese vaccines

Covax commonly buys vaccines. That's not unusual at all.

But this really misses the point. Donations are a tiny fraction of overall vaccine shipments. Most countries rely overwhelmingly on purchases, and the major problem this year has been that vaccine supply has been limited.

The US' decision not to export vaccine in the first half of 2020 was a major contributor of this worldwide vaccine shortage. The world relied largely on two suppliers: China and Europe.

To this day, China has exported many times as many doses as the US. As of October, China had delivered about 1 billion doses abroad, while the US had only delivered about 160 million doses. That's why the US government always goes on about *donations* - it's the only metric by which the US looks good."

The COVID-19 Omicron variant was detected in the Netherlands before two flights arrived from South Africa last week carrying the virus, Dutch health officials said on Tuesday.

At least 14 people on flights from Johannesburg and Capetown arrived at Amsterdam’s Schiphol airport on Nov. 26 carrying the new variant, the National Institute for Public Health (RIVM) said.
“We have found the Omicron coronavirus variant in two test samples that were taken on Nov. 19 and Nov. 23,” the RIVM said. “It is not clear yet whether these people have visited Southern Africa.”
The discovery of Omicron has sparked worries around the world that it could resist vaccinations and prolong the nearly two-year-old COVID-19 pandemic.

Some 61 out of the more than 600 passengers on the South Africa flights tested positive for COVID-19 and went into quarantine after arriving last Friday.
Dutch authorities are also seeking to contact and test some 5,000 other passengers who have travelled from South Africa, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia or Zimbabwe.

In the Netherlands, tougher COVID-19 measures went into effect on Sunday to curb record daily infection rates of more than 20,000 and ease pressure on hospitals."

If Omicron defeats the vaccine, then we’ve just reset the clock to something like October 2020. Since then we’ve had *three waves* including Delta and now Omicron. If that trend continues, we don’t get out of this, ever.

If the reason we can’t return to normal is because we would overwhelm hospitals and we can’t develop vaccines fast enough to defeat mutations then we need to start addressing a different part of the problem.

Yes that solution may take years, but having it solved in years is better than never solving it."

The effectiveness of partial and countey specific bans on the total prevelence of the virus within a country is either unstudied there or the focus is only on the importation on one country. Which is a large part of the argument I presented. By the time individual countries have identified the virus it's almost certainly already in other countries. Once you introduce the virus into a country and have community spread it's just a matter of time. 

Something you need to remember is that country specific or partial travel bans has a cost associated with it. The question is whether or not the cost is worth the delayed infection curve. From everything I've read from epidemiologists and organizations like WHO is that the cost is not worth the benefit."

The full travel ban reduced cases by about 86%, while the impact of a partial lifting of the ban is minimal and may be a policy option.

""Evidence of the effectiveness of travel-related measures during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic: a rapid systematic review""

There was a high level of agreement that the adoption of travel measures led to important changes in the dynamics of the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic: the Wuhan measures reduced the number of cases exported internationally by 70%–80% and led to important reductions in transmission within Mainland China.

""Impact of travel ban implementation on COVID-19 spread in Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea during the early phase of the pandemic: a comparative study""

Travel restriction was effective in preventing COVID-19 case importation in early outbreak phase, but may still be limited in preventing general local transmission. The impact of travel restrictions, regardless of promptness, in containing epidemics likely also depends on the effectiveness of local surveillance and non-pharmaceutical interventions concurrently implemented.

Community spread has apparently already happened in Scotland, and I just saw an article that said it's been in the Netherlands for a week. But I can almost guarantee you that there won't be travel bans from those countries. 

What would make more sense since we have the facilities in place, is to require quarantine and post-flight testing at least until we can know a little bit more about this variant."

Not to mention that proteins are incredibly complex structures in terms of chemical make up and physical shape/folding.

11/30/2021 12:48,"Translation with DeepL:

The RIVM has found the corona variant omikron in two test samples already collected in the Netherlands in November. The samples in question were taken from the GGD on 19 and 23 November 2021. Saltro, the lab that performed the tests, sent the samples to RIVM.

In a special PCR test, the samples showed an abnormality in the so-called spike protein. This led to the suspicion that the omikron variant was involved. The samples were sent to RIVM to confirm this. On November 29, two samples were indeed found to contain the omikron variant. It is not yet clear whether the people in question were also in southern Africa. The RIVM has informed the GGDs where the samples were taken. The GGDs will inform the people concerned and start with source and contact investigation. 

On November 26, 624 people returning from South Africa were tested for the coronavirus at Schiphol Airport. Of these, 61 passengers received a positive test result. A total of 14 of them were diagnosed with the omikron variant. Laboratory testing found different strains of the omikron variant virus. This means that the people were most likely infected independently, by a different source and at a different location. 

Follow spread in the Netherlands
In the coming period, several studies will be conducted into the spread of the omikron variant in the Netherlands. For example, the samples of positive tested people who return from southern Africa will be further examined at various laboratories in the Netherlands. Also, the RIVM will retroactively examine more samples from laboratories that routinely perform the special PCR test and that showed the abnormality in the protein. Finally, RIVM, together with 31 Dutch laboratories, is monitoring the occurrence of variants of the coronavirus through the National Germination Surveillance. 

International information exchange
Internationally, the spread of the omikron variant is being closely monitored. Experts would like to know more as soon as possible. How contagious and pathogenic is the variant? And how well do the existing vaccines against this variant work? There are daily contacts with experts from all over the world about this. For example, experts from the RIVM are represented in weekly meetings of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the ECDC (the European RIVM), and there is a special European network where signals about the coronavirus and variants are exchanged daily. 

Update
The reference laboratories at RIVM and Erasmus MC are working closely with various laboratories and the GGDs to gather more information on the omikron variant. On Tuesday, December 7, the RIVM will provide another update on the situation on its website."

> Interestingly again cases are not growing in Egypt.

Even with rapid exponential growth, it would take time to see these cases. Especially if there are covid cases ongoing already. They are like a needle in they haystack. The only thing that can detect them are full specific PCR tests or genome sequencing on all positive results, which very few countries do - the UK does this and South Africa is doing quite well on this."

That said, the rest of your argument is spot on.  We've known from day 1 that eventually variants would move far enough away from the original that the vaccine would stop working as well, and we'd need to pivot.  That's half the benefit to the mRNA technology - they can get a new recipe out in a few months, rather than needing to start from the ground up and take years."

The result is a virus that replicates and transmits better. I can't see any reason for it to become milder."

11/30/2021 12:31,"So you bring up an important point that we're currently trying to address. The current belief is that that since the Omicron variant has minimal mutations in the S2 protein we could surmise that T-cell immunity may still be effective. 

I'm really trying to prevent getting into a future quoting situation (eg, you said this and were totally wrong since we're still all trying to figure this out). The census opinion (of course this is within 4 days of a genome be published on gisaid), is that it seems like T-cell response may still be intact.

It's really too early to know with anything approaching close to >95% certainty, but so far the vaccines seem to still be efficacious and I would 100% support anyone to get the 2nd/3rd shot since this is such a rapidly evolving situation."
11/30/2021 12:31,"You sound like a troll. But for anyone else reading, there are triple-vaccinated people who have symptomatic Omicron. That is clear proof that the vaccines aren’t providing sterilizing immunity against this variant. And I’m concerned about long COVID and other damage from “mild” cases."
11/30/2021 12:31,"Also intrinsic R0 is likely less than Delta, while antibody evasion is higher, leading to the higher fitness in SA. R0 may be around Gamma as it lacks the mutation in transmission that makes Delta more transmissible in naive population. This is good news for unvaccinated, but less for vaccinated (although those have T and B cells still). So likely more infections in vaccinated, less in unvaccinated. Delta may outcompete as most infections these days are in unvaccinated population. 

It could be that Delta still outcompetes anything else in less vaccinated countries (USA, Germany, Eastern Europe), while Omicron does so in highly vaccinated ones (Portugal, Malta).

Here's a comment I saved from a year ago discussing travel bans. WHO has never recommended travel bans for every previous pandemic, including the coronavirus pandemic. They have done this because the evidence continues to show they are ineffective. 

Since 2009, WHO had declared six Public Health Emergencies of International Concern (2009 swine flu, 2014 polio, 2014 Ebola, 2016 Zika, 2018–20 Kivu Ebola and 2019–20 COVID-19), all of which had specifically advised against implementing any travel or trade bans as a containment measure.

2009: Travel bans don't work. https://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/guidance/public_health/travel_advice/en/

Limiting travel and imposing travel restrictions would have very little effect on stopping the virus from spreading

2010: Travel bans don't work. https://www.who.int/cholera/technical/prevention/choleratravelandtradeadvice231110.pdf

However, the following measures are not advised, as they have been proven ineffective, costly and counter-productive: ... restrictions in travel and trade

2014: Travel bans don't work. https://www.who.int/mediacentre/commentaries/ebola-travel/en/

Travel bans are detrimental and ineffective.

2020: Travel bans don't work. WHO is very consistent in their recommendations.

Travel bans just delay the initial outbreak, but neither the overall number of cases nor the peak number of hospitalizations are actually decreased. Furthermore, border restrictions have to be extremely effective (99% or more) just to win 2-3 weeks of time — if restrictions are, let's say, only 80% effective, they pretty much don't do anything at all.

We find that border restrictions and/or internal travel restrictions are unlikely to delay spread by more than 2–3 weeks unless more than 99% effective.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095311/

Travel restrictions would make an extremely limited contribution to any policy for rapid containment of influenza at source during the first emergence of a pandemic virus.

11/30/2021 11:57,"I don’t agree with your above statement. 

First, the country is 75.4% fully vaxxed which shows me the rate is similar to Canada (75.5%). The campaign to vaccinate 5-11 years old is now starting imminently which will potentially increase the coverage. 

Belgium has also administered a booster shot to 13% of its population which is more than many other countries. I cannot find the data on Canada.ca so I cannot compare but at least at a European level Belgium was in the top 5.

> Unvaxxed crowding the hospitals

While I’m not saying that there are no unvaxxed people in the hospital (proportionally it is a greater crowed), and I am for everyone getting their shots, there are areas where vaccination rate is over 90% where over 90% of the patients in the hospitals are fully vaccinated people. Why? Because they are old (>75), or have an underlying condition. This is the reality. 

I believe the vaccine protects people from severe forms of the disease but it doesn’t work 100%, and it especially doesn’t work 100% if you are an at risk person. 

But when you do a concert where all youngsters are told they can enter with their Covid pass, and not have any social distancing (so I’m not blaming them, they were told it was fine). They may get infected without much symptoms and then the next week they go visit grandma who ends up in the hospital despite being fully vaxxed. 

One thing as well to compare is the size of the studied area and the density of the population in that area. Belgium is a very small, compact and dense country. It should be compared to other places with similar conditions (here you’re comparing a 30.000 km2 country with 376p/km2 density with a 10m km2 with a 4p/km2 density, obviously the situation is different. Clusters spread faster in high density areas)."

11/30/2021 11:40,"“The Community of Madrid is studying whether a second positive case for coronavirus, that of a passenger from South Africa with a stopover in Amsterdam, corresponds to the omicron variant, according to sources from the Ministry of Health.        

This case, which is still being sequenced to confirm whether it is an omicron, arrived in Barajas on a different flight than the first confirmed infected with this new variant. This is a woman who has tested positive in an antigen test in Barajas and in PCR, who was vaccinated with two doses and who has mild symptoms.”"

11/30/2021 11:37,"I remember the portugal cases were discovered in a footbal team and one of the players was in South Africa more than two weeks before being detected. This could also explain how 10% of passengers discovered in the Netherlands with covid were missed at the airport in South Africa. The first Italian case who was previously in Mozambique tested positive 10 days after returning but he was probably asymptomatic. Also currently there are not growing cases in Mozambique so maybe the Italian was another outlier. First Belgium case took 11 days to develop symptoms after returning from Egypt. Interestingly again cases are not growing in Egypt. Exactly the same with the first two cases in Canada who returned from Nigeria, again with no growing cases there. It's certainly very weird."

11/30/2021 11:33,"Take my upvote, and a friendly reminder for others: the clinical definition of mild does not mean it is less spicy than you may anticipate, like ordering a curry.

A mild wound may be a complete surface scrape across both of your shins and knees because you don’t need hospitalization or stitches.

A mild ovarian cyst may only be 3mm, but sometimes they burst and you’re taken to the hospital anyway.

Mild is not Tostitos salsa spicy; it is Thai food mild."
11/30/2021 11:33,Then why did I get vaccinated ?
11/30/2021 11:33,Too early to tell. Gotta run those initial assays. The hope is that if it targets Nsp12 or other non-spike targets that it will still be effective as an anti-SARS2 countermeasure. The live-virus assays will be important since Omicron and other variants have mutations outside of the spike protein. I say this as I have a vested interest in testing a full length variant so take this with grain of salt.

Local pharmacies like Walgreens and CVS seem to have plenty of appts available for kiddos too, but I’m sure the availability depends on local demand.

11/30/2021 11:28,Serious question here ... If someone has already recovered from covid and is comfortable with potentially having to battle it again considering it has a 98% survival rate... why should they get the vaccine? It seems as though there is not much difference in one being vaccinated versus unvaccinated.

11/30/2021 11:28,"How does the public know what strain of the virus is probably confronting them?
How does any person who is  infected know that strain in his system. 
People don't have access to a microscope to ascertain the strain.
If vaccinated you probably won't feel that I'll but still spreading who knows what strain. 
Media is having a panic festival and not confronting politicians with relevant questions.

11/30/2021 11:23,I'd say omicronophobic is a more precise description.

11/30/2021 11:22,Yeah but that wasn't because they were all infected.  It was because one qb was infected and they didn't follow protocol so they were all exposed.  Completely different situations.

11/30/2021 11:21,"It's really too early to know at this point.

As of right now, the evidence* suggests that vaccines should provide similar protection to what we expected with Delta. Biggest issue with the limited sample size from South Africa is that this seems to be infecting children at a higher rate *. (This is hard to tell if it's significant since from what I've heard is that it's expected out of South Africa based on vaccination rates. Again, it's what I've heard, so I'm sorry if someone local has better info. And this could just be conjecture).

In terms of current vaccines there is a fine line to thread since I know there are groups that could be looking at this (This isn't a statement against the current vaccines, but rather that our current vaccines seem to be *largely sufficient  from what I've heard (Many on a call I was on believe T-cell response will be preserved because Omicron doesn't have an excessive number of mutations in S2.) 

I believe there was a call on Friday which I was not on about the current FDA licensed vaccines and where they were with trials and testing. Unless these are in South Africa or have pseudovirus assays we're still on a lag. The ability to scale mRNA and adenovirus vaccines is minimal since at this point we just need a good consensus sequence. I myself spent 12 hours trying to assemble a consensus sequence but I don't have to worry about making something for humans. One of the foremost reporters in our field sent out an early powerpoint on common spike mutations which I could work with. Vaccine manufacturers are a bit more constrained."
11/30/2021 11:21,Get it Friday at lunch. You lose a weekend but gain better immunity.
11/30/2021 11:21,"The article mentions WNY, so was basing off the actual article itself not just the title."
11/30/2021 11:21,Huh. Hospitals have been overrun and there hasn't been any lockdowns
11/30/2021 11:21,Not really.  I suspect many other countries will follow suit.
11/30/2021 11:20,"As a foreigner in Japan, I haven't really noticed any maltreatment during the pandemic. I mask up like everyone else, I obey public safety measures like everyone else, and I've been more or less treated the same as I have before the pandemic. Of course I say this as a white American teacher in Hokkaido, so I can't speak for everyone.

But considering the pigheadedness I've seen from back home over masks, social distancing, and public civility, I wouldn't blame anyone here for looking down on how the US or Europe has handled the pandemic. I kinda don't want to go home to that either.

Say what you want about the government response. The lack of tests has been irresponsible, and allowing the Olympics to go on was one of the worst cases of government negligence I have ever seen. But the civilian response is unmatched, and is what's carrying this country through the pandemic."
11/30/2021 11:20,"New medication being developed like pills and inhalations against the virus will it be useful more than the vaccines, or will this new strain ruin it's effectiveness."
11/30/2021 11:20,Two weeks after the first mentioning of Omicron. When we should start noticing a serious uptick or not in hospitalizations.
11/30/2021 11:20,"Comments like this always seem to be at the top of covid threads, and I'm not sure why.  The data/information is almost always indeed new (in this case having the CEO of a covid vaccine say that he thinks it's likely to be less effective against omicron is a very big deal), but the sentiment ""this isn't anything new"" seems perhaps to have a calming effect for people?  

Yes, there is always speculation one way or another.  The truth is, at the moment, we really don't know (even if it's highly likely the vaccines will be less effective).  Either way, information that comes out pushing that speculation one way or another is indeed useful/informative."
11/30/2021 11:19,"Yup, I live in Manhattan too and wear a mask in most places in doors along with most people I see. I'm immune compromised so I'm glad where I live has a high mask use."

11/30/2021 11:18,I don't know about Moderna and their contract with the US but I remember that Pfizer's renewed contract for providing vaccination doses to the EU already includes updates when a new variant makes it necessary. They don't get paid extra for modifications of the vaccine's mRNA sequence.
11/30/2021 11:17,"I love how scientists are literally in an arms race with mother nature right now, and have been at it for the last 2 years now. Right out of a movie. 

Diseases and viruses of the past that we've quelled or eradicated had been around for ages, and so the urgency to provide protection and cures as soon as possible were not nearly as extreme. 

Probably a pretty exciting time to be working in the field when you get to work on a timeline measured in days and hours, instead of years. That's got to be pretty cool, even if the circumstances are tragic."
11/30/2021 11:16,"You are talking from a pure scientific perspective. That is understandable, but is completely impractical in real world. Never have I denied from a PURE scientific perspective, lockdowns may be better to cope with the virus, but two full years after the pandemic begin, people, government, society, global economies have had enough. 

I will put my word here, any proposal for Lockdown by any western government will be dead even before leaders appear on national TV. 

People need certainty, lockdown provides none of that. You talk about working from home, again understandably since we may have a college degree and a well-paid job.. but conveniently ignoring the fact that a major % of job from many sectors can only be completed on-site. (Most notably, restaurant workers, hotel workers, supply chain workers and many others from service industry). Who pays their salaries during lockdown? And what impact it will have on the economy? Take US as an example. After rounds and rounds of stimulus package, what yoy inflation does US currently stand at? Could feds afford more? 

And you also conveniently ignore mental health issues; they are equally important as physical health. 

> I would like to point out that I didn’t specify temporary, you did

If even temporary lockdown isn’t sustainable, how can an indefinite lockdown be? 

Two years into pandemic, any talks with pure scientific perspective while ignoring societal and economic issues do not make an ounce of sense. This isn’t a fantasy world residing in your imagination, this is the reality."
11/30/2021 11:15,"A lot, lot more different than Omicron.

The number of mutations itself is also not a reliable way to predict 1) immune escape 2) transmissibility or 3) severity. All it does is tell you you likely need to test for these things.

Some mutations or particular combinations of mutations could actually hinder some of the above, including with Omicron. It's still unknown and the Moderna CEO had no basis for his comments, but ofc the intention was to pump his own stock and in that he succeeded."

11/30/2021 11:06,"Think the restrictions will be dependent on whether or not it bypasses the current vaccines. But regardless, it’s time to vaccine mandates that are way stricter than the ones (or lack thereof) we have now. 

I’m so tired of this, but who I really feel for are the people working in every hospital from CA to ME who have to deal with the unvaxxed, who are traumatized every single day because some loser decided to believe the wild conspiracies about covid and the vaccine. They are the people we all need to think about. Health care workers don’t deserve watching the unvaxxed die every day when there’s a perfectly good vaccine out there, and I know we all detest the unvaxxed (I get it, I can’t stand them either) but I can’t imagine what health care workers have been going through since the start of the pandemic. 

We all want to move on with our lives and we have every right to want it. Those who are vaccinated, we did our part and wanting to finally move on from this is completely valid, but I’m pretty sure our health care workers want the same thing too."
11/30/2021 11:06,"Anti-vaxxers aren’t going to change their minds over this. 

We need to wait and see what the data is and actually be data-driven. We can’t be pro-science until it’s inconvenient and waiting is hard. 

Wait a week or two for in vitro studies to come out. But even then, are YOU going to somehow make people wear masks? What will YOU do? Is YOU navel gazing here making anything different?

We have to just hope for good policy and that the data isn’t too bad. That’s all we can do. Sitting here and reading everyone’s opinions right now is meaningless."
11/30/2021 11:05,"I have no idea what you’re talking about, no one ends up in hospital and then in ICU without having symptoms beforehand, there’s absolutely no need for an asymptomatic person to take this"
11/30/2021 11:05,"So, I don’t think this is happening, a lot of this science and data is published publicly.

That said, that is probably the best type of response if that were to be true, panic is always going to be worse"
11/30/2021 11:04,"Omicron gonna bring that self preservation back.  This is [antigenic drift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigenic_drift).

There's no need for the virus to compete with other strains for resources.  The antibodies produced from the vaccine won't target the new RBD.

This is March 2020, with a lot more indifferent and careless people."
11/30/2021 11:04,"Yes. It’s a complex and fluid situation. Does speculating on it right now make for better choices or policy?

Speculation got us boneheaded travel bans. Yay?"
11/30/2021 11:04,"Lmao you think people buy stocks because its good now? If you mention covid 3.0 and say you need to redevelop a vaccine in tandem with your current one, you just printed money out of air.

Thats literally how it works and you can see the results play out in real time."
11/30/2021 11:04,"Maybe. Could be. Until then what are you actually doing to do?

You have no idea. None of us do. We have lots of maybes. We have to track and trace and learn. Until then it’s just a waiting game."
11/30/2021 11:03,hahah oh man
11/30/2021 11:03,"Who would have thought?

Delta has two (!) Spike mutations, this has 30.

But I got downvoted into oblivion when I told people this is the variant we need a new vaccine for.

And it's not that easy, because there could be coming other variants, with other mutations, that are entirely different from this one.

The genetic variance from the different COVID types will only grow further, making targeted vaccines all the more difficult.

Edit: yes, we still have t-cell immunity but this won't slow the spread, thus the pandemic potential is back on the table and we will see a lot of lockdowns coming soon, if this new variant is at least somewhat as severe as delta."
11/30/2021 11:03,"Please watch this if you haven’t already. This aired Friday at around 4:15am EST.

I think everyone needs to ask themselves, how did he suspect this much 4 days after the variant was first identified?

I think scientists and govts know this variant is going to be very bad. I read a retired virologist call it “horrifying”.

So the market’s reaction on Friday maybe wasn’t exaggerated. Maybe tonight’s move isn’t exaggerated.

11/30/2021 11:01,And then get infected with both Delta and Omicron.
11/30/2021 11:01,"Rather fucked for the rest of your (potentially very short) remaining life instead of locked down for a few years? Naaah bro idk, definitely not that way for me"
11/30/2021 11:01,"That, and also the % of people in SA with HIV is greater than in EU/US too. There was even a speculation that the origin of the new Omicron variant is in a HIV patient that might have had chronic Covid-19."

11/30/2021 10:56,"Are these people who checked the wrong box to get the booster? The booster comes in two possible dosages. The dosage for someone immunocompromised is double.

If people are sick for 3 days, the simplest explanation is they lied about being immunocompromised to get it sooner."

The other manufacturers haven’t commented yet.  *Push for update*. Sure. Then what? It has to go into mass production. Shipped. Inoculated to millions. Then there is at least a couple of weeks before they actually start to work.

Timely lockdown will slow the spread and help the health system."
11/30/2021 10:55,"It took just 17 years between the outbreak of SARS to the outbreak of COVID-19 to forget everything, so I guess I’m waiting for SARS-CoV-3 in 2040"
11/30/2021 10:55,"It’s odd to hear that only serious illness and death mater, given that the reduction of the risk of symptomatic illness of any severity has long been the primary metric for a vaccine’s effectiveness. Public health authorities didn’t start saying that only preventing serious illness and death matter until it became clear that we would have to lower our expectations, and only be confident in that level of protection. This is a novel virus, whose long-term health impacts are not yet well-understood, but the early indicators are worrisome – so it still makes sense to want to avoid getting even a milder case."
11/30/2021 10:55,just wait till we hit the 10th variant
11/30/2021 10:54,why december 10?
11/30/2021 10:54,"The key points:

* Originally Pfizer had projected 50 million. So their projection for 2022 is increased by 30 million courses.

* Pfizer's antiviral treatment claims risk reduction of 89%. 

* ""The good news is when it comes to our treatment, it was designed with that in mind, it was designed with the fact that most mutations are coming in the spikes,"" said Pfizer CEO."
11/30/2021 10:53,"Do you really mean ""open source"" instead of ""free""? If news articles were open source, then they would provide the source content for the article from their CMS (without the extra HTML/JS that is generated around the article)."
11/30/2021 10:53,"Seriously and recommending a booster to protect against Omicron is such a risky and potentially damaging strategy. If the data comes out and shows that there's a huge drop in effectiveness against omicron & the third dose doesn't do much to help, anti-vaxxers and the far right are going to latch onto that as proof that the CDC is lying and stupid and not to follow the recommendations. 

And that might convince people who were on the fence. Because this may turn out to be a bad recommendation. it's so premature to recommend a booster for omicron when they did **not** make this recommendation for Delta right when we had evidence that boosters significantly improved immunity to Delta. 

I know they're more concerned that two doses may provide very little protection against omicron when they provide decent protection against Delta & also immunity is warning. But the truth is they don't know how much a third dose will even help that. 

They just shouldn't have linked that recommendation omicron at all. Delta is still the primary variant"
11/30/2021 10:53,"There are certainly examples of data being hidden. A lady who was sharing data in Florida had her computers stolen by men sent by Governor DeSantis. The data didn't fit his ""business as usual"" plan.

This suggests to me that the picture being painted by people like DeSantis is the wrong one."
11/30/2021 10:53,You now have natural immunity. Nature's very own gift to you.
11/30/2021 10:53,"Worrying at least may lead to people who aren't vaccinated getting vaccinated and everyone else wearing masks again.

Considering how low some of the vaccines have gotten over time, a 20-30% drop puts the protection down to much lower than we need it to be."
11/30/2021 10:52,So what? Look at what is ahppening in Europe with just the small drop we got from waning vaccines.
11/30/2021 10:52,Brilliant! Hopefully just in time for any shenanigans that Omicron pulls.

11/30/2021 10:48,"To be fair the market also plummeted on Friday, a drop I would consider to be an overreaction based on very very limited information where the only thing really circulating was “500% more contagious.” I really don’t think all the optimism is a solely for the pumping of the stock market, I think that’s a bit of a ridiculous take. There’s been a disproportionate amount of bad news and dark takes if you ask me, especially with these things being the things that spread easiest in the media. Only optimism I’ve seen is “potentially mild symptoms” among all the “this could be really bad”"
11/30/2021 10:47,"1. Is there a good chance to get truly neutralizing vaccines before next winter?

2. Is it reasonable to assume that the virus is already in many other countries than South Africa? I mean, science is not testing every single person's virus for mutations. It is only logical that science is way behind the virus regarding spreading, isn't it?"

Ah right well that's not explained anywhere. Even says on my NHS covid passport it's a booster of comirnaty (Pfizer).  Also probably confusing because it's not the same as the first 2 vaccines I got so didn't think it was a 3rd."
12/1/2021 12:25,"That’s temperature. Sigh. If I invested 1 dollar in the stock market and in increased by .3 that would mean I have 1.3 dollars. By your logic, if my stock increased by .3 I’d only have 30 cents. On the other hand if my stock increased by 1.3 that’s a 130 percent so I’d have 2.3 dollars"

12/1/2021 12:23,"I’ve been vaxxed, even tho I’m still concerned that there may be negative long term effects waiting for us down the line with the mRNA vaccine.

However I thought it very interesting that the first people to tell us we needed boosters was Pfizer, without any real world data at the time to suggest that they helped.

And then yesterday the CEO of Moderna stated that the moderna boosters should be given at double dose to be effective against Omicron (again, with seemingly no real world data to back it up). Very convenient, if you look at it from a profit point of view."
12/1/2021 12:22,"Should not have watched that video before bed. That woman/doctor(?) seems very concerned. Like, shaking in her voice at the beginning when talking about toddlers.

12/1/2021 12:19,"Yes, then you got a ""third shot"", not a booster. It is expressly labelled as a ""third shot"", so that the system does not block you if you want a booster in six months time.

But, as I said, that has not really anything to do with the specific vaccine; that's just a muddled explanation by the staff, or the way they handled things as they may have only 50%-doses of Moderna prepared and did not want to mix things up."
12/1/2021 12:18,An elementary school in my city had literally 25% of it's students infected with covid simultaneously.

12/1/2021 12:18,1.3 times higher or an increase of 1.3. You ADD the increase. You take the original and add the increase.
12/1/2021 12:17,"In my family, it's the people who were vaccinated begrudgingly that are now vehemently against a booster.  MIL thinks 'she's done', because she got Covid before Delta and was fine.. then vaccinated only so she could travel.  Almost got her grandkids sick the first time too.  

Tried to share latest update on a friendly call and she got all huffy about it, so weird.  She's in her 70s and not the greatest health.
Like, you have personal proof the vaccine isn't harmful.... and see its saving lives.  No one ever said it lasted forever.  Are some people that hung up on being contrarian they'd literally die for it?

I'm afraid a decent amount of people who waited awhile to vaccinate the first time, wont even bother again if no one makes them. Existing mandates but for boosters will have to catch up."
12/1/2021 12:17,so twice as dangerous means 0.0494% risk of dying based on the QCovid Oxford risk calculator?

I'm sorry I know it's a dumb question but I'm not a native speaker of English so I wanted to clarify. I'm just so fascinated by this theory and never knew such a thing could happen.
12/1/2021 12:16,"In both counties on Long Island they are asking for nada, and everywhere is PACKED to say the least even the new Islanders stadium I heard is not even asking for proof of being vaxed, I'm fully vaxed so I take the chance at certain venues because I love places like the Cheesecake Factory, but if there is going to be a spike in NY this winter, L.I will be at the center of it for sure💯"
12/1/2021 12:15,Those countries are paradoxically doing great - compare excess mortality from Covid-19 in sub Saharan countries. Many of the countries w low vax numbers have younger populations w few comorbidities so the effects of the pandemic aren’t quite as tragic.

12/1/2021 12:14,"Thanks for this, SnooB. I was feeling mighty bleak today."
12/1/2021 12:14,"Like I said I'm just going off what was said at the vaccine centre.

If you're a regular person that had 2 doses AZ or Pfizer first ime round then you get a booster of moderna and thats it no more boosters. So this was the sole one being offered to anyone not in the below group.

If you had 2 doses AZ of Pfizer first time and are immune suppressed or other reasons to be of concern (that includes me) then you cant have moderna because that would be it no more boosters it's Pfizer booster and another in about 6 months (or yearly depending how covid goes)

Again I'm just going of what I was told and is in the leaflets I'm not claiming to know all."

It also kinda depends on the cinema, some are more lax, others are strict. I went into Dune, i was really glad they were checking my vaccination passport thoroughly. At that time we had a lower incidence so masks were only mandated up to your seat, while sitting people could take them off (so the cinema can seel popcorn). I kept mine on though, it didnt diminish the viewing experience. In contrast to public transport cinema felt safer."

One medium-sized outbreak, let alone a large one, will presumably overwhelm their response strategy. (How many cities can they lockdown at once and for how long?)"
12/1/2021 11:10,They said the reason they are pushing moderna to people who had AZ or Pfizer first time is its 1 dose and that's it you don't get another booster unless something drastic changes (weird becauseit's only a half dose booster). Where if you have say AZ then Pfizer you have to have another Pfizer in 6 months or so.  I knew nothing about this until I went last week and the information for why is really hard to find online.

12/1/2021 10:56,"Long term effects of the vaccine are also poorly understood. Only recently myocarditis has been found in vaccinated children. 

It is wrong to think people under 40 are at risk for covid. If you say this, you must also say this for a million other deseases, like unfluenza. Covid is much more deadly than influenza only when talking about risk groups.

Obviously you cant tie people down to vaccinate them. Not even china does that. Maybe force is the wrong word, but they lose their job and income if they dont get vaccinated. I dont see how that is not forcing something on people."
12/1/2021 10:55,"It doesn't work that way.  Transmissibility and virulence tend to be linked through in-host replication rate.  This is why delta has higher inherent transmissibility and is more virulent/deadly.  This is the ""tradeoff hypothesis"" that virulence is a result of transmissibility.

Any strain which outcompetes delta through inherent transmissibility is likely to be worse than delta.

Now if the virus is forced to make mutations to achieve immune escape because basically everyone has some immunity through vaccination or exposure, then it can mutate so much that a new serotype emerges, just like influenza does.  The need to make those mutations may come at a cost to fitness and therefore lower virulence / lower in-host replication rate / lower inherent transmissibility.  The virus will get worse at inherently being a virus, but will be favored due to immune escape.

And we don't know enough to engineer either of those outcomes."

12/1/2021 10:48,"My feeling on why there is no end in sight is those who don’t want the vaccine or precautions when they’re available. Those spreading misinformation or actively working against science and numbers.

I’m no wealth of knowledge or source of truth but I think trying to spread information and positive discussion around precautions is one of the way to help move things along. To the point of immunocompromised I was under the impression you couldn’t get the vaccine (or it’s advised you don’t) but as you indicated it seems like I’m wrong there.

As far as when do we not need to wear mask? I don’t know if anyone knows. I almost wonder if it’s more of a when do we realize wearing a mask isn’t a bad thing and less of a “forced to wear it” (I’m not saying your stating forced). I don’t have a lot of experience with Asian culture, but they seem to be praised for their high usage of masks. I have a coworker who mentioned it just becomes a normal thing in Japan, are you sick? Wear a mask. Want to be left alone? Wear a mask. Is it cold outside? Mask up! Where I’m from in America I still see people who wear their mask hanging off their face. I’d argue why bother putting one on if you’re not even going to try and cover up but that’s obviously more the people just complying to the rules rather than attempting to prevent a disease."
12/1/2021 10:47,"Nope. But everyone was required to have a corona-pass to enter which means everyone was either tested, vaccinated or has natural immunity.  It will be interesting to follow this situation to see to what extent virus has spread to other people."
12/1/2021 10:47,"Mobile, but look up seasonal change effects on infectious disease epidemiology.

Not 100% scientific, but data suggests that waves in airborne epidemics sync strongly with changes in population behaviour. Equatorial regions have their different cycle, mostly revolving around rains. Hot climates peak in summer, cold climates when it starts to get cold.

You can probably guess how the population behaviour changes."

I can’t imagine that alpha is struggling because it can’t find any individual hosts because they are already all delta positive.

12/1/2021 10:44,"> Covid vaccine protects you better for the first couple months yes. I meant to say that for healthy people under 40 it doesnt really matter, since they are not really at risk.

I think perhaps you have a poor understanding of risk. It is in every way incorrect to think that those under 40 are not at risk for covid, or at risk of dying from covid. It's true that it's less often lethal, but the long term aftereffects of covid are not yet fully understood. increased risk of heart disease is one of the after effects that we know of.

> I dont see the point in forcing this vaccine on healthy soldiers, but that is just my opinion. 

It's not being forced on them. I'm really not sure where you get that. It is a requirement for them to stay in the military. If they feel that sensible precautions are not necessary, they are free to leave. The US has an all-volunteer service. No one is forced to enlist."

The UK found it because it was the only one looking, shared the information and then suffered negative consequences. South Africa found this new variant and was immediately cut off from the world - it's not hard to imagine other countries thinking twice about sharing results from sequencing."
12/1/2021 10:28,I can feel you. I am not yet vaccinated as my country hasn't allowed to vaccinate people under 18. I am 17 and a half. I am constantly sanitizing or washing my hands or any stuff that has come from outside. It's to the point where my skin has started to suffer. I wear two masks everytime i have to go to school. I almost never go outside and regularly take immunity boosting supplements. This has been my routine from January 2020 till today. I try to think rationally but after the second wave in my country in April of this year where we were having 300k to 400k cases daily and hospitals ran out of oxygen and beds. That had a major impact on me i am scared always. Therapy is a really good step you are taking i also started therapy just few months back. It really puts things into perspective.

A large number of my friends never sought out any sort of higher education, and many of them work in grocery stores, warehouses and other jobs of that sort.

12/1/2021 10:09,"I've been really starting to realize how much COVID has messed with me mentally. I'm noticing how much of a hypochondriac I am. I think a lot of this is because my university tests us vaccinated people weekly, but the anxiety I get about my tests every week is unreal. It's unrelenting, every day. Either I'm worrying about the results I just took or that the next one is going to be positive.

I know this makes no sense in my brain. I've actually had 4 doses of the vaccine. 2 trial shots in the Novavax trial, a J&J shot for proof of vaccination, and then a Moderna booster. But still, I get intense anxiety whenever someone coughs anywhere near me, regardless of the reason, or anything like that.

I know this doesn't make logical sense, and I know I need to stop. But it's just been getting worse and worse as it gets more and more ingrained into me. I'll be starting anxiety medicine soon, and I go to therapy, so hopefully I get better soon.

COVID has completely wrecked me mentally. I just need to fall asleep and wake up when it's all over, actually over, because the way I feel on a daily basis is not okay. Before COVID and especially before this semester and the weekly testing started, I was doing okay. I used to not be a very anxious person at all. But I'm broken now because of COVID and stupid restrictions that don't make sense, like testing a boosted 21 year old every week.

I lost some of the most important years of my life because of this, and I feel like I am losing my happiness as well. I don't like how this is all changing me.

I'm sorry for the rant, I just don't think enough is really done when it comes to helping people who are suffering mentally as a result of COVID."

Every Walmart and Kroger pharmacy in my current area (suburb of atlanta) has the vaccine and booster available (the local walmart marketplace has pfizer, moderna, and j&j).

in one of the more rural locations in the Northwest I used to live in the same is true but the vaccine is a little bit more of a drive for some people.

I assume the smallpox vaccine was forced on people for their own health. For a non risk group the covid vaccine is taken to protect others. Not that it doesnt protect you as well, just that covid is not really dangerous for non risk groups.

Haha, this is one of her points. If she got vaccinated since it was available in our country she would already had 3rd shot. But she managed not to catch covid during all this time."
12/1/2021 9:47,"Yeah, and that is anecdotical evidence by the doctor who said that, since she called a hospital and asked them about the patients.

Also, her definition of mild is to not require a visit to the hospital/doctor.

The media outlets took that phrase out of context and it pisses me off. Now a lot of people (at least in my country) are hoping that it gets here and infects everyone so it's over. We don't even know how truly severe it is, as that data may be 1-3 weeks away. I only hope that it's milder than Delta and it's able to outcompete it."

12/1/2021 9:44,"Local Catholic Church was handing out conscientious objector cards - basically saying people could choose not to be vaccinated if they believed it to be morally wrong.  Loads of locals who hadn’t been to church in years showed up to get these cards and try to get exemptions to vaccine mandates.

While the Pope has been very clear, the church has decided not to punish insubordination against God’s appointed representative on earth.  

An organization so recently filled with pedophiles is now, in North America, pretty far right and anti-vaxx"
12/1/2021 9:43,"For a lot of people getting a test 24h before isn't that easy.

Some places have a lack of infrastructure for testing, some of the testing places are overloaded, getting a PCR test result in under 24h is impossible in a lot of places."
12/1/2021 9:43,"Although it looks scary, it's pretty much just as steep as when beta took over, and beta never really spread around the world. Same slope as delta also (which obviously did spread). 

For some reason, SA has variant-fueled spikes which then die down to almost nothing. [Check out their case history.](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/south-africa/) 

Clear spikes for alpha, beta, delta, and now the start of omicron. For now, it doesn't look different than any other spike - we'll have to wait and see."

12/1/2021 9:42,"I am immunocompromised. 

There is no reason why someone who is immunocompromised can’t get the vaccine. We can’t have live vaccines for obvious reasons, this is not a live vaccine. I am vaccinated x3 and wear my mask in all enclosed public spaces. 

It seems I’ve come off as an anti-vaxxer/anti-masker. I’m not. I guess my question is, what is the end goal with slowing down COVID? To eradicate it? And if that’s not possible? Your point about developing countries not having the vaccine, by all means, absolutely, we must do everything in our power to help them. But speaking in terms of the US, at a certain point it’s just going to be a matter of some people don’t want the vaccine, and we can’t make them take it, so there will always be infections, mutations, deaths etc. so when do we decide we don’t need to freak out at the sight of another mutation, when we don’t need to wear masks everywhere and so on. 

I’m fine with wearing masks assuming there is an end to it but with how it’s been going it doesn’t feel like there is."

12/1/2021 9:39,"I feel you. I got married, graduated, took a new job... All literally a month before COVID hit. Sometimes I feel incredibly anxious wondering what would've happened if all of this had been pushed forward by a little bit. I might still be unemployed to this day in that case.

These thoughts are normal. What I do is try to help out people (who weren't as unfortunate) in whatever I can, i.e. donating to loved one's hospital bills or trying to help others find jobs."

12/1/2021 9:37,"According to the data from Israel natural immunity far exceeds inmunity from vaccination - by a factor of at least 6. So it is very likely, that natural immunity will remain somewhat superior even to boosted immunity."

12/1/2021 9:37,Herpes GOAT virus
12/1/2021 9:37,"Unless you eradicate the virus (unlikely) it’s a bit of new way of life. We do this until we’re okay with the results (partly because we don’t have a choice).

Annual vaccines for things like Flu shot is not a new norm, so there’s a good chance COVID may end up similarly. Some people don’t get a flu shot every year. Some people die of flu. There will likely be yearly COVID deaths for years to come.

Again for my personal stance on when do we accept this? When vaccines are available for all ages, so 4 and under. I don’t want my lack of mask or vaccine to impact anyone else. Even once younger age vaccines are more available, there’s also immunocompromised people who can’t get the vaccine. You also mention the variants which to highlight the previous point the less spread there is, the less mutations there will be. There’s still countries around the world with very little vaccine coverage and likely where some of the variants are originating from. If we help limit the spread globally, the new variants will likely reduce in numbers or frequency."

I think we’re just going to see a death cycle of the unvaccinated and immunocompromised. That doesn’t include hospital infrastructure, resources, or other social tensions.

This. China's ability to control the spread of the virus (or the spread of information) has been somewhat impressive, even if one doesn't agree with the kind of society (or interior politics) that is necessary for this ability. There will be a limit, however. When this limit is reached, all hell will break loose in China. Whereas the rest of the industrialized world has had two years to adapt and experiment with ""soft"" measures, China might face a sudden exponential outbreak in 22 or 23 if they don't vaccinate everyone now."

Part of it is cost and another part is ambiguity. Air filtration upgrades can be expensive, but it is also hard to know exactly how effective it would be, because there are several variables making an impact. For example, maybe there is a good filter but the air is circulating too slowly for it to make a difference. Or you may have excellent filtration and air flow but people are still too closely packed."

So you would need 100 people who have been fully vaccinated to get sick before you know the amount in which Omicron is evading the vaccine if at all. Not going to speculate, so for now Im going to remain patient until more data comes out before I decide to be concerned or not.

Edit: Also it takes upwards of 14 days for serious illness and up to a month or longer for someone to unfortunately pass from Covid. So also keep that in mind while reading the inevitable media blitz that will be 10x more confusing then when we found out this variant existed."

Preliminary data: The vaccine protects highly effectively against the new variant
Marciano Foundation

The information received in Israel about the Omicron - the good and bad news: After Bennett's declaration of ""state of emergency"", in Israel tonight received preliminary data - both from South Africa and Europe - on the new variant that is causing concern around the world. The data revealed tonight (Tuesday) in the ""main edition"", shortly after being received in Israel, are preliminary - but indicate that the vaccine is still effective against the newly discovered mutations.

The data were collected in both South Africa and European countries where verifications were found in the new variant. It should be emphasized that these are preliminary data that the whole world is waiting for, and at this point they become the working assumption. According to these data, the effectiveness of the vaccine (for those who received three doses, ie also the booster), decreases only slightly: 90% protection, compared to 95% protection against the Delta strain. These are impressive and somewhat reassuring figures. The effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing serious illness, for those who have been vaccinated three times, is the same as the effectiveness against the Delta strain - the strain that has been the most dominant in Israel so far.

The alarming data

But not everything is rosy: the problems start with the risk of recovering from being infected. The data show that the risk of recovering from infection is twice as high as in Delta, and the rate of infection is 1.3 times higher than in Delta. This rate of infection is very high: in South Africa there is talk that in 15 days the number of patients has increased 15 times. Although the numbers are low, the rate is problematic and worrying: in Israel there are many Israelis who are not vaccinated.

Another worrying statistic has been revealed regarding the unvaccinated: their risk of becoming seriously ill is 2.4 times that of the original strain of the corona, the one that arrived in Israel nearly two years ago. In ""unvaccinated"" the reference is also to those vaccinated in two doses who are entitled to a booster and have not yet been vaccinated and therefore their protection is insufficient. Despite this news, the data is a reassuring siren when it comes to protecting vaccinated people from both serious illness and infection.

The contradictory messages of vaccine manufacturers

The test of the effectiveness of existing vaccines against the new variant was in its infancy, but Modern CEO Stefan Bensel managed to arouse global concern today when he said in an interview with the Financial Times that he expects a significant decrease in vaccine efficacy.

But Bensel spoke of a decline in benefit from a disease with symptoms rather than a serious illness - a difference that is known to be dramatic in corona contexts as Pfizer CEO Albert Burla was apt to describe: Defense compared to Delta but that would be the limit. In both cases, the booster vaccines are expected to reduce the gap dramatically. ""

Burla, who promised to know more about the benefits of the vaccine against the variant in about a week and a half, said Pfizer had already begun developing a specific vaccine against the variant a few days ago. ""We know the genetic linkage of the virus, we have it - that's how it starts,"" he explained. ""We started, at risk, to produce a vaccine. We actually started on Friday to produce a vaccine based on the flooring, the DNA template, that would allow us to make RNA that would eventually women within that vaccine.""

Israel, meanwhile, is waiting for a more categorical statement from the two CEOs, and meanwhile relies on data coming from South Africa - where the variant was first discovered - and from which it appears that the omicron is more contagious but is no more violent.

""Data on the benefits of the vaccine - there may be some partial data from South Africa,"" Dr. Sharon Elrai-Price, head of public health services, said today during a debate in the Knesset. I know they are doing the lab tests as I described to see how useful the vaccine against this variant is. ""
Bennett worried: ""There is a lot of uncertainty""

Albert Burla and Naftali Bennett (Adapted by Reuters)
Burla optimistic, Bennett explains why he activated the GSS | Arrangement: Reuters

At the same time, the government is today approving a memorandum of law that will allow it to extend the decision to allow the GSS to verify the cellular devices of those infected with Omicron or the suspects who were infected with it with high probability - in order to interrupt the transmission chains as quickly as possible.

But just before the move reaches the Knesset, the coalition itself is sharply critical of the law. Prime Minister Bennett - who saw for himself how in the ministers' WhatsApp groups Ministers Saar, Shasha-Bitton, Barbibai and Avidar voted against - told today why Israel decided to include the GSS in the campaign despite, and perhaps because it is a low number of infected.

""There is a lot of uncertainty and that is why we are taking these extreme measures,"" he said in a video call with Austrian Chancellor Alexander Schlenberg. ""But our advantage, as leaders, is that once we know more, when there is more information - we can let go of those measures, gradually."" As for the restrictions at Ben Gurion Airport, the prime minister has already decided that these will last about two weeks from the date of the decision - and only if the final proof does come that the variant does not endanger the population's immunity or the omicron is already spread in the community - these restrictions will be removed.

12/1/2021 9:08,"Depends on the virulence. If Omicron is about as virulent or more and outcompetes by spreading faster, that could be quite bad. If it is significantly less virulent, that would be an improvement. If it evades immunity to vaccines/previous variants and is pretty virulent, that would be very bad and we could possibly end up with both around for quite awhile. Delta out competed several variants due to being more transmissible and so is almost the only variant circulating right now."

-	There were less metropolitan cities in North America, therefore many still lived in remote or semi-rural areas, pre-Dirty ‘30s

Think of our medical technology for a second. Think of how many metropolitan citizens are refusing to even be tested, let alone hospitalized. We’re getting pummelled, but if this happened in 1918 with our level of transportation and globalization? Not good. If this happened pre-digital? Still not good.

There’s no sense in panicking, but comparing the 1918 H1N1 (or any pre-2010 CoVs) to 2022 SARS-CoV-2 is flawed, and detrimental to factual public health informed by geopolitical and sociopolitical history because people are manipulative as hell."

Began feeling sore after <9 hours, took extra strength ibuprofen and heat bags, and Gravol to sleep. Woke up at about 01:00 and felt like the worst flu body pains I’ve had in many, many years; maybe since childhood growing pains, but all over my arms and legs. I was in so much “bruise” pain that I cried and my partner had to rub my back. We were both in pain, but I’m hypersensitive to internal pain, so we just rotated in bed, rubbing each others backs and whimpering.

It dissipated by Day 2 late morning, and pretty much disappeared by Day 2 late evening. Definitely felt weak; felt more normal by Day 3 evening.

I’m still going to get my booster, but it definitely was not something I was expecting compared to flu shot aches. It was about 3x worse. I’m gonna book off four days instead of two, and maybe ask my psych for a 1-week scrip of lorazepam because I have an anxiety disorder. Not fun, friend.

I’ve only had one friend out of dozens of peers to say the same. Most of my friends did the Pf/M combo, and I didn’t hear anything from them or on social media about hit-by-a-truck pain. Seems like we’re outliers, hopefully."

Also very tough to blame anybody in particular but I have not seen any reason to doubt that a wave will not be mishandled again. I lived through the shit show basically feeling like I was in a warzone and this article majorly grates me. Just seems like a paid ad.

12/1/2021 8:10,Pfizer is a 30 microgram dose while Moderna is 100 microgram for the original series and 50 for the booster. The higher dosage could be why the side effect profile for moderna is slightly worse and why it has held up slightly better to delta.

It is true as they mention in the article that for 6 weeks straight now, every day there are local transmission somewhere in China. However that also means for 6 weeks, they've managed to completely stamp out each of those small outbreaks one after another.

Also either disingenuous or just ignorant, but you mention the extremely rare side effect of myocarditis from the vaccines but ignore that Covid itself causes mycarditis. Some studies have shown that up to 60% of people with even mild infections show signs of heart damage akin to having had a heart attack even months after Covid symptoms resolve. 

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2776538

A physician cannot charge the fees to a BC resident. I asked once if a person could just pay out of pocket and I was told not if they are a resident, that is not possible because of recent changes in the law. the whole thing has gone to an appeal at the supreme court."

In all honesty, I have eager students as well. But it is very different as a student vs working in the field. Additionally the ""shortage"" isn't so much a shortage as it is long term issues relating to management cutting corners everywhere on everything. Some call it ""hire to fire"" in that hospitals count on fresh students, who do not know any better, to work grueling hours to the point they either want to quit or get fired when the next round of students come through. Unfortunately, I have seen this at the majority of hospitals I have worked with in pretty much every department. 

I'd love to be optimistic, I really would, but given how things have been handled the entire pandemic in the medical field, I am not optimistic. It is sad for me because I know it ultimately affects the people I take care of. Yeah I want to fight for a raise and better working conditions, but a big part of that is my desire to help people.

Having spent decades in service,  I completely understand why and how this mandate will be extremely difficult and costly for many businesses.  For some,  it will be so difficult and costly that they simply cannot comply in such a way that is mandated. For many other establishments, it will be easy to implement and enforce. 

I'm going to continue to listen to the people who are actually doing these jobs. I'm going to believe them and do my best to support instead of criticize them and make demands. It is my opinion that these people have been put through enough. I hope you come to believe the same

12/1/2021 8:01,"it could very well just be delta that hit your immediate area, though.  Rather, that is *far* more likely, it is still far and away the most common variant in the country, and is running rampant.  Nearly 100% of cases in the US are delta, no reason to assume your town is any different or that this has any connection to the variant that so far has not been confirmed anywhere near you."

12/1/2021 7:59,"Some of it falls into the class/socioeconomic divide that defined the original uptake. If you’re white or Asian and generally well-off, the odds are a lot higher that you and your social group have gotten a booster. That’s a big reason why vaccination seems to fall into pockets (even by zipcode)."
12/1/2021 7:59,Hope this is true!  My daughter is 16 with asthma and got her first shot the day she was eligible so she’s well over six months. I can’t wait for her to be eligible for a boost!
12/1/2021 7:58,I've gone to Walmart for all of mine. They have always had availability in my city while other stores had none. Try for the neighborhood markets if you have those near you.
12/1/2021 7:58,"Imagine paying $600 (and risking legal consequences if caught) instead of just getting a free shot. I guess if you believe the vaccine is just that dangerous (more dangerous than a virus that has killed millions and harmed millions more)... Also, she must be thinking of carbon dioxide, right? (Still incorrect, obviously.) I'm not sure I understand where the carbon monoxide would come from."
12/1/2021 7:58,"Makes total sense. A lot of people feel that way. I’ve got friends who work hourly and cannot afford to be knocked out for a while. One major retailer (and probably more than them) have a cap of like 14 days total on COVID leave days, and for my friend who’s gotten COVID twice and still wants to be fully vaccinated, it’s really a personal sacrifice to do that when everything is stacked against him.

I’ve put aside good medical procedures before for the same lizard brain reasoning. We can’t blame people for thinking that way. It’s just the reality of how hard it’s going to be to push additional doses of an already inconvenient vaccination, and a reason why we should be concerned about Omicron and Delta and other variants where boosters are a critical part of the solution."

12/1/2021 7:56,"*India vaulted 19 spots in Bloomberg’s Covid Resilience Ranking of the best and worst places to be amid the pandemic, marking a turnaround for a country that saw the world’s fastest-growing Covid outbreak earlier this year.*   
  
*The South Asian country is now ranked 26th in the monthly snapshot, which measures where the virus is being handled the most effectively with the least social and economic upheaval. The league table assesses 53 major economies on 12 datapoints related to virus containment, the economy and opening up.* 

*India’s improved showing is largely due to a rapid economic reopening after daily infections dropped and an initially sluggish vaccination drive picked up steam. The country has now administered more than a billion doses.*  
  
*High levels of natural immunity are also potentially at play in India in curbing infections, with some serological surveys putting previous infection rates as high as 97% in some areas. After reporting a world-record of 400,000-plus cases a day in early May as the delta variant ripped through the crowded nation of almost 1.4 billion people, pushing its health care system to near collapse, new infections have now dropped to less than 7,000.*  
  
*Which factors boosted India’s showing?*  
*Of the 12 indicators that make up a nation’s Covid Resilience score, the biggest contributor to India’s rise in November was the reopening of its borders to vaccinated travelers from many places in the world. This put it in a group mostly comprised of Western developed economies that are welcoming back visitors.*   
  
*The second driver for India’s jump is the increase in its flight capacity in November versus the same period in 2019, as people resumed business and leisure travel. Domestic travel traffic recovery had already been buoyant for a few months but with the addition of international flights, India is now in the top 10 for the Flight Capacity Recovery indicator.*  
  
*While official cases still number in the thousands daily, its vast population means that India’s per capita infection rate is now just 23 per 100,000 people in November, almost as low as the Ranking’s November No. 1, the United Arab Emirates.*   
  
*India's new daily cases have plummeted very rapidly in the past few weeks*  
    
*Blistering GDP growth expected in fiscal year 2022 of 9.5%, one of the highest in the world, also helped bolster its showing.*   
  
*What does the situation on the ground look like now?*  
*Pretty normal. Most restrictions across India’s states, which oversee public health matters, have been eased in recent months after cases stayed low despite the country’s peak festival season.*   
  
*Malls, schools, restaurants, cinemas and bars have reopened while many workplaces are prodding employees to return to work.*   
  
*With the emergence of the omicron variant, Indian health-care authorities have re-imposed airport testing as well as home quarantine for fully-vaccinated visitors from places that have detected omicron cases. The country is yet to report a case of the newest variant, though scientists believe omicron is likely just going undetected so far.*   
  
*What does India need to do to further improve its ranking?*  
  
*India has a large number of people who have yet to get their second vaccine shot: only 32% of the total population is fully vaccinated. Anecdotally, health workers are struggling to get some residents in rural areas to return for the second dose, and under-18s, which make up a third of India’s population, are still ineligible for inoculation.*   
  
*The country also struggles with patchy and inadequate genome sequencing, which means it can’t identify and track new variants fast enough. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has been criticized for downplaying the early warning signs of delta’s existence before it was designated a variant of concern in May, allowing mass public gatherings to continue during state elections and religious events despite soaring infection rates.*   
  
*The emergence of omicron, which has been identified in more than a dozen countries within a week of being sequenced, is re-igniting fears that India might again be too slow to respond to a new variant. Its high level of reopening means that any resurgence of the virus will spread more rapidly than in places where containment measures are still in place, a situation in which India’s fall down the Ranking would again be swift.*"

I'm not pressed about likely getting covid at some point in the future because the vaccines work and I'm confident I'll make it through ok if it happens."

Lizard brain: “ew no that sucked, don’t do that!” Rational brain: “covid would probably suck more, last time it was only 24 unpleasant hours. Just do it and get it over with.” I hope it’s obvious I’ll do it, but that’s pretty much why I haven’t yet."
12/1/2021 7:54,It became 90% quickly because SA had almost zero cases when it emerged. It's easy to become the majority when the baseline starts so low.
12/1/2021 7:53,"Yeah, no completely agree. I just feel like we shouldn’t lump all these people faking papers with antivaxxers that should be forced to get a jab, any at this point.

12/1/2021 7:48,"*China reported 91 new local infections of Covid-19 in Inner Mongolia on Wednesday, as an outbreak in a border town continued to pick up steam.*   
  
*While most of the world is now focused on the potential damage from the novel omicron variant that was identified last week in southern Africa, China remains dedicated to the increasingly difficult task of containing the virus and restoring its Covid Zero status. It has been more than six weeks since there were no local daily infections reported.*   
  
*All of the newly transmitted infections were found in the city of Hulunbir, the National Health Commission said in a statement on Wednesday. Two additional people without symptoms also tested positive. All are in quarantine while contact tracing and mass testing are underway to search for additional infections.*   
  
*The latest flareup originated from overseas and is unrelated to previous outbreaks in China, a health official said at a press conference on Tuesday. It is concentrated in Hulunbir, which borders Russia to the north and Mongolia to the west.*  
*Harder Containment*  
  
*The ongoing spread of Covid, even from unrelated outbreaks, poses a challenge to the world’s most populous country. While its closed borders and strict curbs offer some protection from the new omicron variant, the difficulty in returning to zero new cases shows just how hard it has been for China to eradicate the more infectious delta variant now that it has taken hold within the country and is transmitting widely among its neighbors.*   
  
*It’s also testing whether China’s Covid Zero approach - embracing the strictest travel curbs and implementing lockdowns after even single-digits flareups - will be practical and sustainable.*  
  
*“My belief is that it’s going to be impossible to achieve Covid Zero,” said S.V. Mahadevan, director of South Asia Outreach at the Center for Asian Health Research and Education at Stanford University Medical Center. “Someone who’s infected will slip through, and as Covid evolves, future generations may be more infectious and spread even more quickly.”*   
  
*The number of new daily cases reported Wednesday is close to the peak level from the last wave. China is facing increased pressure from imported infections, even as the omicron variant starts to spread elsewhere, said Mi Feng, a spokesperson of the National Health Commission.*  
  
*“New local cases have mostly been found in border and port towns since November, so China will firmly stick to the strategy of preventing imported cases from abroad and resurgence at home to minimize the impact of the virus on the economic society,” Mi said.*"

Long COVID data is harder to find, but googling i found claims between 1-10% of symptomatic cases in kids have at least 1 symptom of COVID longer than 5 weeks. The most common being things like a lingering headache or general tiredness. General consensus seems to be “it’s hard to say.”"

12/1/2021 7:37,"Just start with enforcing for here orders or the seating.    Lots of creative ways to go this.  For one, they probably already have to ask if the order is to go or not for tax purposes so you can start there.  

You can also provide customers with something to have on their table to indicate they have been checked and are vaccinated, similar to those numbers on a stick many restaurants use to show them where to deliver your order.  Not only does this help fulfill the requirements of the mandate, it also signals to the customers that you are checking. 

Sure, some people may fall through the cracks but at least your doing something and moving towards the right direction instead of being apathetic and lazy.

12/1/2021 7:34,I would also just like to point out that for example Mexico City vaccinated its population (millions of people) with the Russian vaccine and there’s no other easy way to get another brand without traveling to another country. So not everyone is an antivaxxer.

Fool me once, shame on ... shame on you. Fool me... You can't get fooled again!"
12/1/2021 7:32,Everyone will get it eventually. The point of vaccines is and always was to make it as mild as possible when your turn to pay the piper comes around. At this point expecting not to get covid at least once in your life is like expecting to go your whole life without catching a cold.

Not every restaurant/cafe/ whatever is a standard ""get seated by a host and wait for your server"" or ""show your ID to a bartender for service"" establishment.

Think of a Starbucks.  Most of their customers are taking drinks to go and don't need to verify. Some might end up lingering or talking to a friend.  Some may change their mind and take a seat.  It would be impossible for a busy Starbucks to get verification from every single customer.

The biggest hurdle is that they share space with a retail shop,  so many just kinda wander in and sit down without ordering anything.  They would have to place an employee at all three entrances to enforce the vaxx mandate."

Big hugs.  Love you too."
12/1/2021 7:26,"The US brand of Catholicism is a weird place these days. I grew up in a left leaning catholic household, which didn’t use to be an unusual thing. I eventually dropped the religion but kept the politics, as did a lot of people I grew up with.  It was a pretty common rite of passage. 

US Catholicism has lurched rightward compared to the global Church (to keep up with the evangelicals I suppose, who stole the previously “catholic issue” of abortion and ran with it as a political football). Most Catholics I know these days indeed do not like Francis and at best pay lip service to the global Church, though they were fervent about the “infallibility” of JP2 and Benedict.  

Politics is the real religion of most churches these days. 🤷🏼‍♂️"
12/1/2021 7:26,"That makes sense. In some ways, I'm fighting for my kids. If they lost an aunt/uncle, it'd be really hard for them. It would be difficult for my husband. Horrible for my parents in law. Even in death they would punish the people I love. 

But I understand what you're saying. I'm sorry your son is being illogical. I hope something changes for him."
12/1/2021 7:25,Your parents are extremely privileged. Most parents don't have 3 vaccines
12/1/2021 7:25,"It mutated in an unvaxxed individual. But yes, more people in the global south should have been supported by developed nations for more equitable vaccine distribution."
12/1/2021 7:24,Just great. I'm only safe until Friday. Not eligible for boosters for months.
12/1/2021 7:24,"Goodness.  Are you in the US?  Walgreens in my area was opening the future appointment slots near midnight on the days they got shipments in.

A couple of my staff drove together two hours away to a more rural area that had initial doses available when the city pharmacies and clinics were full.  Maybe the demand pattern for boosters is similar?"
12/1/2021 7:24,">“God damnit this shit again? Alright, let’s keep this shit around.”

Immune system is chill and very reasonable."
12/1/2021 7:24,"Regardless of your views on the vaccination, this is a fraud and should be addressed accordingly"
12/1/2021 7:24,"Most of the damage is done by us and our decision to keep it around: ""Let's not do anything … oh, now the damage is happening, we need to do a lot!"" … ""We almost beat it, let's undo the success!"".

Currently China is trying to prevent us from infecting and killing their people. 

There is no evidence of it coming from a lab, much less being engineered. Trump wanted to do some industrial espionage and to (illegally) see their personal's private and medical records in order for them to say no, that's our ""evidence""."
12/1/2021 7:23,Yeah except it’s only my unvaccinated friends not getting it. Wtf is this plot armor bullshit
12/1/2021 7:23,"Yes. I sympathize with people who feel they got the short end of the stick, however…

No one should have ever bought into the idea that you can 100 percent escape a virus through behavior. 

Blame the experts, politicians and public health bodies for drawing a line in the sand between “good behavior” and “bad behavior” but don’t blame your neighbors."
12/1/2021 7:23,"Seriously, it takes the same time for a liquor store to ask for your i.d. 

I get there are way more complications (low wage workers being the enforcement force, dealing with unruly costumers, the owner of a small business potentially losing business by turning away anti-vaxx assholes money,) but the excuse of “it’s too hard to ask” is absurd."
12/1/2021 7:23,Relax. Unless she is super old or super fat she will be ok.
12/1/2021 7:22,What we don’t need is a variant that’s super lethal to those who haven’t been vaxxed….

12/1/2021 7:21,"Agreed. So often in comments about COVID I hear a “well, sucks to be unvaccinated” attitude—people often forget about kids under five, and how despite their resiliency many develop long-term and possibly permanent symptoms."
12/1/2021 7:21,They also have a younger population which makes comparisons difficult between countries like Italy with an older pop.
12/1/2021 7:20,Actually both are acceptable. Technically it’s Michiganian but people say Michigander when they are trying to sound folksy.
12/1/2021 7:20,Is your aunt by any chance the president of Brazil?
12/1/2021 7:20,"I think that’s their overall intent - to make it so logistically difficult that folks won’t consider international travel. Incredibly unfortunate for those wanting to get back to see family in another country for the holidays. This seems a little reactive before the full data even comes out, especially since they’ve been preaching patience for the past week."
12/1/2021 7:20,"Just like military is staffed at 10000% of their day to day needs in order to be ready for the one moment when they need everyone - the war. Exactly the same with ICUs, healthcare and pandemic."
12/1/2021 7:19,There are reports from around the world of it being present and now we are starting to hear that it was present outside of South Africa before South Africa announced it.

12/1/2021 7:19,"It depends, honestly. Some vaccines (like Hep B) have three doses to ensure a longer immune response – the way my GP explained it was basically that with some stuff, the immune system is like “Alright, we haven’t seen that in a while, we can chill” 6 months after the second dose – but after a third dose, it’s like “God damnit this shit again? Alright, let’s keep this shit around.”

But the real answer is “we don’t know yet” because there isn’t a large enough population who has gotten 3 doses with at least 6 months since the 3rd dose, plus time to follow up and then analyze the results."
12/1/2021 7:19,Do you have to wait six months to get your booster? I was in my normal doctor's office today getting some bloodwork done + getting a flu shot and saw they had a piece of paper taped to the door for boosters but since I was already getting a flu shot I didn't think to ask about it.
12/1/2021 7:18,"Right until they start serving drinks/food (no alcohol of course because antimaskers ruined that for us). Then anyone who doesn’t like masks gets to spend the remaining hours nursing a tiny cup of water. The few times I’ve flown during the pandemic (AA if that means anything), there were way fewer masks once the drink carts started rolling, and the first time I flew the people behind me were talking about how they can’t wait to abuse food/drink so they could take their masks of for the rest of the flight."
12/1/2021 7:18,"Xi is a harsh authoritarian dictator. My guess is he is doing it for geopolitical influence, and not necessarily a strong sense of empathy."
12/1/2021 7:17,Try texting your zip code to 438829...I'm betting boosters would be included at the provided destinations.
12/1/2021 7:17,"Hopefully sooner than later, seeing as you’re too stupid to spell herd"
12/1/2021 7:17,"When you note that roughly 3 billion people have not had a single dose, it is important to remember 100% of the 5 and under population cannot get dosed yet, and the availability for those 5-11 is relatively new (not sure how available it is in general outside of the US etc)."
12/1/2021 7:16,It isn’t even a half dose for everyone who got Moderna. My 3rd dose was Moderna – first two Pfizer – and it was a full dose because I had a medical exemption before the half dose was available/approved.
12/1/2021 7:16,"An educated guess would be that people with HIV would also tend to have a higher vax rate than the general population. Just a guess, though. It would be interesting to see real numbers."
12/1/2021 7:16,a lot of those exist just aren't that significant to get news coverage or worry anyone

You can tell who has not actually been affected in 90% of these comments. Thanks to vaccines I'm not living how I was living a year ago but I'm definitely not living like I was 2 years ago. 

I don't understand why there's such a pushback on things like ""don't go to work sick"", ""don't stand right on top of each other in stores"", etc etc to not kill each other"

But since most transmissions dont result in death, I would expect the virus to become more transmissible at a faster rate than it becomes less deadly. Just saying, it might get worse before it gets better."

You also have to factor in peoples’ immune system. Some people seem to pick up every little bug they’re exposed to, and some people seem to never get sick. 

To answer your question: the masks bother me greatly. I wore mine religiously in order to try and protect others from a deadly disease, but now that vaccines are widely available, I don’t want to wear mine anymore. I would much rather get the sniffles maybe once a year and then be fine then wear a mask all the time. 

Anybody who doesn’t feel discomfort from the mask should probably keep wearing it, and people particularly prone to getting sick should, too. But I feel like we’re rapidly reaching diminishing returns here."

12/2/2021 14:36,"To reach heard immunity you do not need 99.99999% of an animal population to be immune, you need something like 70%, depending on the details. Because the virus transmits from animal to animal.  

So with sufficient immunity the virus stops spreading. Or if you stop the spread in another way such as wearing masks, that will also cause the virus to stop spreading. When it stops spreading it dies out. 

And yet another way is with a sufficiently robust testing program. We know this because breakouts of STDs in adult film actors are very rare.

Finally, I positive that If everyone wears a high-quality mask in every appropriate situation, then the virus will go extinct. If it can’t spread it can’t spread.

You make it sound like it’s impossible for viruses to go extinct. Polio? Whooping cough? Smallpox? Fine, for those viruses, incredibly rarely, there are incredibly small outbreaks, so technically they are not fully extinct in the wild.

12/2/2021 14:28,Yup. My friends and I have already bought intense masks and have changed our behaviors until we see what’s going on.
12/2/2021 14:27,"Yeah. After getting double vaccinated, a bunch of medical residents at my local hospital all got covid from going to lollapalooza together. Probably delta.  They all had symptoms, from runny nose to fever and chills, it’s not like we regularly test asymptomatic hospital staff. They were young and healthy, no complications, but we were very concerned at the time that maybe the vaccines were being evaded. Unfortunately in a lot of cases it just prevents severe illness.

And that’s why I’m concerned about the holidays. I’m young and healthy ish, 3x vaccinated, but unsure I want to be in a room with allll the old people in my family. 

I’m certain all the children and at least half the family haven’t had 3 shots."

Now we have vaccines and boosters, delaying the spread of Omicron means we can vax more people and save more lives before it takes over. Our travel ban didn't last forever, the SA won't either."
12/2/2021 14:26,"What’s scary is that, unlike the earlier incident, the most recent event is among fully vaccinated individuals.  The similar spread rate points to significant vaccine evasion by Omicron (even accounting for lack of boosters)"

12/2/2021 14:25,one person asked what the benefit would be.  as mentioned below 1) its needless but 2) the theory of nasal vaccines is that they would be more effective at blocking breakthrough infections as they would elicit local antibody and T cells in the nose where the virus first enters the body - in most cases.  That is what is being studied in the current clinical trials.

It will take one hunter dispatching a deer in intimate fashion to breathe in a new radically different variant for this to start all over.

The CI of the increased risk vs covid-negative patients is 2.35-4.73.  Severe covid patients were at 2.35-4.73 times the mortality risk of covid-negative patients.

I expect that's still a wider CI than the authors would like. The takeaway is more that the floor for the CI is still at an ""oh shit"" level."

Every day humans do things they never did before.  We have never lived with the Earth in this exact position in the solar system, galaxy and universe.  Radiation could be really bad.

For the last million years we have no history of using Reddit has long term issues.  It is so new.

Every flu shot we get is unique every year, we have no idea the long term effects of flu shots with four unique strains.

We don’t know the long term effects of 4K TV’s - they could cause long term vision issues.

We don’t know the long term effects of drinking pumpkin spice products, sriracha, watching Avengers Endgame or streaming media.  Every day we live on a planet with more people then they every have.  Could be dangerous.

We absolutely know the short term effects of COVID. 1 in 200 die.  1 in 100 in the hospital.  Most likely 1 in 50 with long term health effects.

Every single thing we do as humans has never been done before.  That’s simple biology, chemistry and physics.  Science helps us predict what will be good or bad - and tens of thousands of the top scientists in the world have recommended these vaccines.  3 billion humans have taken it and no one has turned into magneto.  

But some people have fallen for the foreign propaganda.  We can’t help them.

And back to the original point, religious leaders are not encouraging vaccine resistance because they are concerned about the long term health of their flock.  They are trying to stay relevant, and dishing out this anti-vax cards might bring back some people who haven’t attended mass in the last 20 years."

12/2/2021 14:08,"It doesn’t look like the omicron variant is a mutation of the delta ‘family’. Europe is Delta. I.e. delta is >99% found in the Netherlands. Seems unlikely that omicron was ‘created’ in Europe.

12/2/2021 14:07,"> Can the influenza vaccination be given together with the COVID-19 vaccination?

> Yes. According to the STIKO recommendation, there is no longer a vaccination interval of 14 days between COVID-19 vaccinations and the administration of other so-called dead vaccines. The vaccinations can be given simultaneously, i.e. at the same time. The injection should be given on different limbs.

> As usual, the influenza vaccination should be given in late autumn (mid-October to mid-December). Provided that there is an indication for vaccination against both influenza and COVID-19, the two vaccines can be administered at the same time.

> A detailed education of the person to be vaccinated about the possible, increased temporary local and systemic vaccination reactions is particularly important when administering COVID-19 vaccines and influenza vaccines (including high-dose vaccines) at the same time. https://www.rki.de/SharedDocs/FAQ/Impfen/Influenza/faq_ges.html"

[India's Ministry Official source](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1777164 ): 


 - The cumulative number of COVID-19 vaccine doses administered in the country has crossed
125 Crore ( i.e., 1250 million doses) today (December 2, 2021 IST). 

 - Out of which, 79.13 Crore (84.3%) beneficiaries have been vaccinated for 1st dose and 45.82 Crore (49%) received 2nd dose of vaccine as per the provisional report."

12/2/2021 14:02,"hello everyone, sorry if this is a bit off-topic, but I am curious about national guidelines on getting Covid vaccines and flu shots in different countries? I come from a small country in southeastern Europe, and the last official communication from the national institute of public health about flu/Covid shots was late October, stating that both can be taken the same day, or separately with recommended period of 14 days in between two vaccinations. Before that, some doctors claimed those two vaccines shouldn’t be taken together cause it confuses the immune system and results in weaker response to both viruses. I understand new data was gathered with time, leading to changed recommendations, but our national public health services' communication is generally lacking, and contributing to confusion and hesitance among people (and everyone can follow international sources).

  
I should get booster in January, and if I’ll be getting a flu shot it will be in December (many doctors here are not fans of giving it to younger people, my doc was unwilling to give it to me couple of years ago, when I was in mid-20s), so it wouldn’t be any kind of issue for me, but some in my family are becoming more and more vaccine hesitant and bad communication from official sources doesn’t help, along with sensationalistic headlines in the news outlets. I am sooo tired of (mis)information cacophony and its results."
12/2/2021 14:01,"They can be. It's accidental and rare though. In nursing school you're taught to gently pull back on the plunger to make sure you aren't mistakenly in a vessel. If you see a flash of blood in syringe,  need to find a new place. I think some places are overehelmed, giving shots too fast and missing this step. Most of the time it doesn't matter,  but every now and then you'll get an unlucky spot and it does. I saw an article a couple of months ago speculating that most severe side effects from the covid shot comes from  this tiny mistake."

If they can ask us if we use tobacco and increase your rates due to tobacco use then the unvacvinated will certainly be discussed. The more money insurance companies pay for medical bills the more our insurance premiums increase for both vaccinated and unvaccinated.  Our company stopped allowing employees to sign up with BC/BS due to their unreasonable increase in insurance premiums.
12/2/2021 14:00,"basic biology for one. but if you want it explained i'll try.

first no mask is 100% efficient unless you are giving everyone scuba tanks with a month of oxygen in them. 

there will always be people who are treated for diseases and some of those treatments require the removal of masks (think surgery, intubations, taking of pills, etc) so there will always be the spreading of germs.

viruses evolve, so even if you were to successfully prevent 99.99999% of the spread through some set of methods, those viruses that live will be those which can evade those methods and when they multiply your plan will break down even more than it already has.

those viruses have different periods of time that they can live outside the host, depending on temperature, humidity, etc so you'll need air scrubbers and decontamination showers for all.

The epidemiologist says it is not surprising that the omicron variant of the coronary virus has been diagnosed in Iceland. Now, however, it remains to be seen whether the Covid-19 vaccine will protect people against this new variant of the virus.  
  
""It was expected that this would come here as to other countries. I think this is much broader and more widespread than we realize. I can only see from information from Europe that the diagnosis of this new variant is increasing very fast, ""says epidemiologist Þórólfur Guðnason in a conversation with the news agency.  
  
""The big question is just how it will behave. It is not entirely clear yet. ""There is some evidence that it is more contagious than delta, but there is nothing completely clear about it and there is no evidence that it is a more serious variant, causing a more serious disease.""  
  
  
The big question now is whether the omicron variant will escape vaccination. Some of those diagnosed in Europe have been vaccinated, but none have been seriously ill.  
  
The omicron-infected person had just received a booster dose  
It was confirmed yesterday that one has been diagnosed with the omicron variant in Iceland. He is now in Landspítali but he had not been traveling abroad, so it is still uncertain where he became infected with the virus. Þórólfur says that he had just received a booster dose when he was diagnosed with the infection.  
  
""It's hard to say, but there's a trace going on around this individual and of course it could be that it's related to a trip abroad. We just need to see a little, it takes a while to work out, ""says Þórólfur.  
  
""He was fully vaccinated and has just received a booster dose, we need to see how the vaccine works on this new variant and whether it works to some extent. It could be that even though people are infected, it protects against serious illnesses, it also needs to be revealed. ""  
  
Þórólfur says it is clear that someone who was traveling abroad infected him.  
  
""Yes, it's like that and all the new varieties are coming across the border and spreading out so that this is perhaps broader and it should come as no surprise that there are more people around this individual who will be diagnosed.""  
  
The third dose is promising  
He says that it would not come as a surprise if omikron has spread further in society. With regard to illness, it is not yet clear how seriously ill people can become.  
  
""It's just impossible to generalize about the fact that nothing can be generalized from one person. This individual is inside Landspítali, as has been stated, so we just need to see how the wind blows and how it will be. We receive daily information from Europe, the European Union, about illness. They are very quick to present all new information, we just need to keep a close eye on what happens in the near future, ""says Þórólfur.  
  
Whether the vaccine protects against serious illness remains to be seen.  
  
""I would like to mention that we need to look at our data with regard to the delta variant and then the second dose and the third dose. We have been in collaboration with the Center for Public Health Sciences and Thor Aspelund has been calculating it for us and it turns out very well. It is at least ninety percent activity of the third dose in excess of the second dose against the delta variant, ""says Þórólfur, which is very positive.  
  
""And it should be a special incentive to encourage everyone to go for the booster vaccine because we still have the delta variant and we need to protect ourselves as best we can. So we hope that the booster dose will at least help with this new variant as well. """

But back then, we didnt even have delta.

It's in the freaking name, it's for those who got their shots in January and no longer get protected efficiently.

But one thing is that can be done without increasing medical risk, because vaccine production is in part a commercial risk, and production is one of the bottlenecks at the start: We could finance the companies to build up capacities quicker, just in case that the alarm is true. If it is a false alarm, we would have to write off the money, but if it is true we would have the quantities we need for months earlier. 

Also, there is a large amount of logistics that need to be solved, like transport and cooling. We spend so many billions on fighter planes, this is a smarter way to spend the money."

i think people only believed that up to the point of vaccine availability for all. now for 99% of the vaccinated an unvaccinated person's choice is solely their own and it will only impact them and their family. but to that end, the US government should stop paying the medical bills of those who catch covid (regardless of status) and health insurance companies should start taking vaccine status into account since it does in fact cause drastically different medical bills to the vaxxed versus unvaxxed. only then will people actually feel the benefit or penalty of their own choice."

If you want to move outside of the city, and only go into the office for meetings and team events, great!  As long as you are productive and do your job, it shouldn't matter where you do it from.

I don't go into the office and probably won't after the pandemic.  I still meet work buddies for lunch once a week and drinks after work every few weeks.  Some of them started after the pandemic.   I certainly don't need to socialize in an office setting.  Most of the team that I work with on a daily basis don't even live in the same time zone as me - there is no reason for us to go into offices in separate states to collaborate by Zoom and email."

12/2/2021 12:58,"But it has a high rate of people previously infected with delta - if I remember correctly, as much as 72%. 

The mayor difference that Africa has is that far less people are older than 60 years, which is the most affected group in industrialized countries.

I'm absolutely livid - but not because politicians are breaking promises. Fair enough, desperate times, desperate measures and I trust them to scale it all back.

https://theconversation.com/will-coronavirus-really-evolve-to-become-less-deadly-153817

> There is little or no direct evidence that virulence decreases over time. While newly emerged pathogens, such as HIV and Mers, are often highly virulent, the converse is not true. There are plenty of ancient diseases, such as tuberculosis and gonorrhoea, that are probably just as virulent today as they ever were.

> A change in conditions can also drive the trend in the other direction. Dengue fever has afflicted humans since at least the 18th century, but an increasingly large and mobile human population is thought to have driven a marked increase in virulence over the last 50 years or so. Even the seminal case of the rabbit-killing myxoma virus is uncertain. There was little subsequent decline in virulence after Fenner’s early reports, and it may even have risen slightly.

12/2/2021 12:39,"No one knows the end game. Public health officials repeatedly sketched a vaccination campaign, then a freedom day and from then on, the virus would be endemic due to herd immunity. 

Then Alpha happened followed by Delta. Now, everyone is a bit more cautious. We know by now that the summers will be OK and people should be encouraged to go out and infect themselves but it's an open question what will happen next winter.

With any kind of luck Omicron is a harmless variant that is just super contagious. In that case, we'd see one hell of a wave in the next two months with lots of deaths, but after that, it would burn out and recede. 

Then, we should get vaccination versions 2.0 next year, tailor-made for Delta and Omi. And lastly, the longer it goes on, the better science will understand the virus, care givers learn how to battle it and pharma companies will develop drugs.

But a zero-COVID death policy is certainly nothing anyone still believes in. It's going to be around for long."

12/2/2021 12:38,"Pretty sure it wasnt omicron. Due to non pharmaceutical interventions like masks many other respiratory infections saw a decline, and now come back to a population who didnt develop antibodies (but also a lot fewer people died from influenza). We saw this increase now also in Respiratory syncytial virus mainly in children. That being said some influenza waves hit stronger than others.
You would know if you had covid with a PCR test, antigen tests are less reliable, depending on brand, but should mostly test positive if you have symptoms and therefore high viral load. Couldve also been a nasty strain of common cold etc.
Oh and dont forget to get your influenza vaccine if you havent already."

12/2/2021 12:36,"I share this general sentiment - I think there's a common fallacy that a case prevented now is a case prevented forever, when it may just be delayed. And the costs of NPIs need to be seriously considered.

Nonetheless, there are decent benefits to delay beyond hospital capacity. It gives more time to roll out boosters, which appears better than two shots ever were. It gives more time for promising antivirals to be approved and rolled out. In the case of new variants like Omicron, it gives time to figure out what's going on and then potentially time to develop and roll-out variant-specific vaccines.

What's the end game? We can't say it with certainty because we don't know the future. In March this year, I would have said the end game was herd immunity from the vaccines within months. A couple of months ago, I would have said the end game was right then - double-dosed against delta is as good as it's going to get. Now, it's very up-in-the-air about what's going to happen with Omicron.

The ""end game"" will probably only appear obvious in hindsight. Let's say than over a 12 month period, there's been little change in the Covid situation. A few new treatments, but nothing that'll reduce the risk of severe outcomes by anything like 90%. New variants, but nothing that freaks out governments much more than an annual flu mutation would. As time went on, we'd be increasingly confident saying ""this is the endemic state now"". But we might be many months into it before we can be that confident."

I don't care. That's my point, it doesn't matter that Belgium also has the new variant, or that UK and USA doesn't implement travel bans to/from SA.

We heard there was a horrible cold/flu going around and assumed it was that. Now I'm wondering because the symptoms are identical. Probably 30% of all the people we know have been hit by it (with differing degrees of severity but near identical symptoms).

I did an antigen test at the time and it came up negative. I guess most of our friends would have also done one and results came back negative. 

Is there a highly infectious flu going around, or is it possible that Omicron isn't showing up the same on antigen tests?

12/2/2021 12:12,"JOHANNESBURG, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Data from an area in South Africa hard-hit by the Omicron variant of the coronavirus has shown a high number of hospital admissions of infants under 2 years old, raising concerns that the variant may pose risks to young children.

South African scientists have said they cannot yet confirm a link between Omicron and the high admissions of infants, which could be due to other factors. Here is what we do and do not know about the issue.

WHAT IS CAUSING CONCERN?

Register now for FREE unlimited access to reuters.com

The data, released by South Africa's National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD), shows that 52 infants under age 2 were among 452 COVID-19 patients admitted in Tshwane - the metropolitan area that includes the capital Pretoria - in the period between Nov. 14 and 28, a higher number than for any other age group.

However, taking into account the size of the populations of the various age groups, the risk of admission was higher for people over age 60.

HAVE THE ADMISSIONS BEEN LINKED TO OMICRON?

No. Only a small percentage of positive test samples in South Africa are being submitted for genomic sequencing to detect the variant due to limited capacity. That means we cannot know for sure whether the infants in hospital were infected with Omicron, NICD scientists have said.

There is also uncertainty about whether all of the infants included in the data are infected with COVID-19, as not all are tested for the virus, scientists said.

For practical reasons, infants who present with respiratory symptoms are treated as if they had COVID-19, but they could be sick with another disease such as flu.

HOW SICK WERE THE ADMITTED INFANTS?

The data shows that 29% of COVID-19 admissions in the 0-to-4 age group had severe disease - a proportion similar to that in several other age groups, and significantly lower than the percentage of severe disease among patients over 60.

Among those age 4 or younger, 1% of admissions resulted in death, according to the data. However, the total number of admissions in that group was 70, making it unclear what the 1% figure represents.

The NICD did not respond to a query from Reuters about that and other elements of the data, saying it would issue a new report on paediatric admissions later this week.

SHOULD WE BE WORRIED ABOUT A POTENTIAL OMICRON LINK?

Asked whether people should be alarmed by the infant admissions numbers, Professor Anne von Gottberg, clinical microbiologist at the NICD, told Reuters: ""Not yet.""

""It looks like in fact some of those admissions might have started before the emergence of Omicron,"" she said. ""We are concerned enough that we are looking at the data very, very carefully, but at the moment I'm not too sure that we can link it definitively to Omicron.""

WHAT ELSE COULD BE GOING ON?

The province of Gauteng, where Tshwane is located, has experienced an increase in flu cases in the past month.

""We need to be really careful to look at the other respiratory infections and diseases to work out why were children being admitted. Were they being tested as they were being admitted or was it precautionary?"" said von Gottberg.

NICD scientists also said that parents with sick babies and infants were quick to bring them to hospital, while patients in other age groups were less likely to rush in.

WHEN WILL WE KNOW MORE?

The NICD said it was preparing a report on paediatric admissions which should be available by the end of the week.

The World Health Organization said on Wednesday it expected to have data on Omicron's transmissibility within days, but scientists said it could take two-to-four weeks to learn more about the variant. read more"

2. kinda depends on the country, we have these yellow, international vaccination passports, where vaccination-kind, date, doctor etc is documented. Then you can digitalize it, you will get a QR code, e.g. at a pharmacy free of charge, which you can either print out or save in your mobile phone, we have special apps for that, also free of charge of course. This code is also a proof of vaccination and lets you enter restricted areas, who are only accessible for vaccinated. 

The american white card is also valid in europe. But it could be a bit of a hassle as locals dont often get into many people with it as of yet, as international travel is rare.

I simply fear that (as they cannot drag people out of their houses and forcefully vaccinate them) the ""mandate"" will be enacted in terms of high pressure: no public transport without vaccine, no travel without vaccine, no cinema without vaccine, no job without vaccine, etc. And this type of pressure usually motivates young people much quicker and in much larger numbers than old people who are mostly sitting at home all day anyway. So the (likely) approach to any mandate like this will motivate those who we need to vaccinate urgently (60+) the least and at the latest point in time.

To me, this lowers the case of any restrictive measures that aren't justified by the threat to healthcare capacity.

Also, the FDA screws up all the time, so no I do not trust them 100%.

I am not saying vaccines do not work, everyone in my family got vaccinated yet we still caught covid regardless, no one died or got severly sick though.

12/2/2021 10:54,"I don't meet my family members, I have [Mysophobia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysophobia) and as such social meetings are a big no-no for me. We talk regularly over zoom calls and such though. I already never met people before corona, I wear masks regularly since I am 8 years old most of the time, even without people and alone at home."
12/2/2021 10:53,"According to the company, all participants were required to test negative on an anti-gen test before going to the christmas party. That means that Omicron either transmits very easily or evades antigen testing in early stages."
12/2/2021 10:53,"Hopefully this isn’t anything to do with how the Omicron variant acts, because if it is then that’s scary af"
12/2/2021 10:53,Well if it is confirmed that is not good at all
12/2/2021 10:52,Good.  If you're immune compromised might wanna keep up your boosters.  When antivirals come out have those at the ready too.
12/2/2021 10:51,"My dentist is fully aware of my condition, as such I am always the first (or last, I prefer first) patient in his office so I meet minimum people, it's still horrifying for me. :("
12/2/2021 10:51,"I would.  Vaccines should hold up well against omicron.  Probably decent sterilizing immunity if you're boosted.

Get your shots and live your life.  Get a regular booster if your want to be extra protected."
12/2/2021 10:49,Lies
12/2/2021 10:49,"I have [Mysophobia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysophobia), getting a jab from someone else is horrifying. Waiting in a doctors office with people sneezing and coughing is pure terror for me, I think most have no idea how incredible hard this is for me, I can try but I can't promise anything. :/

I am worried the needle might not be sterile, it's not that easy to overcome. If I could vaccinate myself without anyone I would do it, since I can be sure nobody has contaminated the needle."
12/2/2021 10:49,I think its pretty evident that being vaccinated isn't going to make any difference as to if you catch omicron. It might make it a mild case (here's hoping) but if its so infectious to the vaccinated then the unvaccinated are going to be assailed from all sides as it rips through the vaccinated community with no effective isolation in place.
12/2/2021 10:49,"No but he was very careless. Just because there is no lockdown or government mandated masks/quarantine doesn't absolve you from your moral responsibility to think about your situation and act accordingly. I'm sure he didn't infect people on purpose and lax/slow government action is also to blame, but he himself obviously has part in it as well."
12/2/2021 10:48,Keep in mind boosters are irrelevant in this case seeing those are given at least six months after the second shot. These people were presumably still protected by the initial vaccinations.
12/2/2021 10:48,"Lol, you still don't understand that the metric of positivity rate is exactly the control metric to assess if a country is testing too little...

Look at the change of positivity rate in SA's graph, look at the amount of testing done. It's all there, you are wrong and don't understand the metrics, math and statistics behind it.

And you still come out to write this whole wall of text without knowing what you are talking about, oh well. Good luck."
12/2/2021 10:48,">“When you look at the numbers of admissions by age, what we normally see is a large number of admissions in older people,” she added.  
>  
>“But in this early resurgence in Tshwane, we are seeing most admissions in the 0-2 age group.  
>  
>“And we are seeing a large number of admissions in the middle ages, sort of around 28 to 38.”

Well, that's not good...

>She said “very high proportions” of young children were being admitted — more than 70 per cent of cases in the 4-and-under age group.

And that is just odd.

>Almost 30 per cent of children aged 4 or under had “severe disease”. The percentage of those admitted with severe disease was slightly higher for the five-to-nine age group, at more than 30 per cent. It was slightly less for the age 10-19 group at about 27 per cent.

Rather worrying.

>About 1.5 per cent of children aged 4 and under admitted to hospital died. There were no deaths among children aged 5 to 19 in the two-week period.

Unfortunate.

>“It doesn’t look at the moment like there is any increase in severity, but it is early. Admissions do lag about two weeks after cases and it takes some time for patients to have an outcome, so this is something we will watch and give more information in the coming weeks,” said Dr Jassat.

Finally, some good news.

<The “vast majority” of those admitted to hospital were unvaccinated.

That's surprising...  /s"
12/2/2021 10:48,"Having a sufficiently large network of treatment places would be insanely expensive, so politicians prefer to ignore the problem."
12/2/2021 10:47,"Never thought of this before but that's a really thought-provoking comparison, in terms of actual lives lost and resources spent."
12/2/2021 10:47,"It's funny what counts as ""Reputable"" in the UK these days."
12/2/2021 10:47,have any unvaccinated people gotten Omicron yet?
12/2/2021 10:47,"I don‘t think it‘s this meaningless.

It‘s not like those guys breathed in some virus particles and where tested right afterwards and they found the breathed in particles.
If they did the test properly, which i guess they would, they have waited multiple days and the virus particles they found where reproduced in their body.

What we don‘t know is how bad the symptoms will be and how contagious they will be.
But both differs wildly from case to case anyways, 
with a lot of factors: immune system response, general health, original viral load, previous infections, maybe some genetic dispositions"
12/2/2021 10:46,"I haven't seen my family in two years. I'm triple vaxxed (Moderna) and was so excited to get a chance to fly back home this year before the omicron news hit. Now I'm not so sure if I should. Where is everyone else's heads at in regards to travel?

ETA: I live in the US fwiw"
12/2/2021 10:46,"[This is false](https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-011488089270) ""“That claim as a whole is just nonsense,” said Troy Day, a professor of mathematics and biology at Queen’s University in Canada, who has studied the ways infectious diseases, including coronavirus, can evolve.""

“The virus, speaking anthropomorphically, just wants to spread and have its genes replicated,” said Adalja. “If the best way for it is to spread by causing severe symptoms it will continue to do that.”"
12/2/2021 10:46,Time will tell. Omicron is just starting to spread.
12/2/2021 10:46,Wasn’t there a UK study showing delta to be less lethal than its predecessor?
12/2/2021 10:45,Expect this to be discussed in John Campbell's next youtube.
12/2/2021 10:45,As an immune compromised person I’ve limited the only times leaving the house to just doctor visits when necessary. I kept telling myself this would end sooner than later and I’d feel better about going out but I’m definitely at my limit. I will patiently wait for more data on this new variant but as long as it’s not like 10 times worse than delta I’m going to start living again.
12/2/2021 10:45,"In Germany, there are 3 million people over the age of 60 who are unvaccinated. Someone claimed that vaccinating them could reduce the number of Covid patients drastically (like, 85% or something). So since mandatory vaccinations will be a pain to supervise and see through, I'd prefer the Greek approach and introduce the mandate for the over-60s first. The age bracket can still be moved downwards later."
12/2/2021 10:44,Username checks out
12/2/2021 10:44,Not a single death till this is confirmed with this variant in any country
12/2/2021 10:43,"Our Republican-controlled House voted 60-48 to strip our Governor of the emergency powers she had been using to enforce sensible health precautions. 

That was July of this year.

And now here we are. Worst in the nation."
12/2/2021 10:43,"Pumping the brakes while you gather data does work, if your goal is to slow cases while you figure out how serious things are. We'll get those cases eventually, *but not all at once*.

I'll be honest, I don't know how to really respond to someone saying closures don't lower cases, when it's obvious it does and the data says it does? It may be more than you and others are willing to bear, which I can totally understand, but the data says masks clearly slow spread and you believe that."
12/2/2021 10:42,A lot of mask wearers removed their mask for an extended amount of time while eating indoors and they wonder how they got it.
12/2/2021 10:42,"What makes you say the government wasn't concerned? It was the big news of the day, and travel restrictions were put in place the same day he arrived. 

It's called common sense, and in this case it was uncommon. We have morons too, no need to read into it."
12/2/2021 10:42,And I bet you're going to need assistance breathing in the next 3 to 6 months.
12/2/2021 10:42,Any evidence on reinfection cases?

You think he did it on purpose.  


Okay bro."
12/2/2021 10:39,Have you just returned from SA?  Stay the fuck away from large group gatherings moron.
12/2/2021 10:39,Oh look. A virus is evolving. How shocking (Spanish flu is still with us today)
12/2/2021 10:38,"Even so, the thought of “we just went through a pandemic, and this one is tiny so we won’t worry about it” is gonna give omicron one hell of a body count."
12/2/2021 10:38,"Show him around, Tim!"
12/2/2021 10:38,Or people who refuse the vax because “we don’t know the long term effects!” And then demand all the experimental treatments that we don’t know the long term effects of when they get Covid
12/2/2021 10:38,That’s reaching. Usually means the opposite
12/2/2021 10:37,"So Omicron is/seems to be more infectious than other COVID strains... does that tell is anything about the viral load, incubation period before being contagious, whether Omicron is transmitter in the same way (droplets and some smaller particles in the air, not as much by touching surfaces)?"
12/2/2021 10:36,I hope the kid's parents did not assure you s/he was vaccinated...I would be irate.
12/2/2021 10:36,"Buddy, you gotta work on your reading comprehension, especially if you're going to be arrogant in your responses. :) I mean that in the most polite way possible. 

OP is saying that many people are immune *to less immune evasive variants* (e.g., Alpha, Delta). More cases may be due to Omicron *evading immunity more*. OP is in no way shape or form saying that Omicron is not evasive to some extent; it's the opposite."
12/2/2021 10:36,"You can't put anyone at risk if they are vaccinated because the vaccine protects against serious illness, hospitalisation and death."
12/2/2021 10:36,"Interpreting this is useless, it’s all anecdotal still. As much as most cases now being mild. We need to wait and see. Everything is an if now."
12/2/2021 10:35,"The mask (heh) always slips eventually. WW2 lasted years, but not even two years of asking people to get vaccinated and mask and people like them would rather throw 1 out of every 100 people off a bridge instead. (Except getting thrown off a bridge would probably entail much less prolonged pain and suffering.)"
12/2/2021 10:34,"I mean these reports:

https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/11/29/south-africa-omicron-fourth-wave-vaccine/

https://www.thenationalnews.com/coronavirus/2021/11/29/covid-patients-aged-2-and-under-most-likely-to-go-to-hospital-in-south-african-epicentre/"
12/2/2021 10:34,So your plan is to keep up with restrictions until when then? Because immunocompromised will never be able to get vaccinated
12/2/2021 10:34,Your statements don’t contradict mine.
12/2/2021 10:34,But what if everyone is fully vaccinated like in this scenario? Still don't do social gatherings ever?
12/2/2021 10:34,"Yes but a lot of selection bias at play. Everyone here was tested because of the situation, but I bet many breakthrough cases in other situations aren't symptomatic and aren't tested."
12/2/2021 10:33,You got me intrigued. I'm going to scare up a copy. Thank you!
12/2/2021 10:33,"The article isn’t clear. 

2/3 of the country has been living lockdown free for 95% of this pandemic. 

When Delta arrived we tried to eradicate it but quickly realised that wasn’t going to happen in Auckland. 

As a result Auckland has been in lockdown for the last 3.5 months to get as much of the country vaccinated as possible. That lockdown has eased over the last 6 weeks but fully ends in 2.5 hours. 

Fully opening international borders to tourists etc is scheduled for next year. Omicron could always change that."
12/2/2021 10:33,"2a. Looking at case counts and not severity complicates it for the same reason. Better testing identifies asymptomatic cases, whereas reluctance to test will be associated with only more extreme cases identified."
12/2/2021 10:33,It's also much more likely that a person at this event would have a positive test with a breakthrough vs someone else who shows no symptoms and never gets tested. So there's some selection bias here
12/2/2021 10:32,My office was supposed to be back in september and pushed it back to January because of delta. Hopefully they'll do the same with omicron. I know I've been filling my bosses inbox with complaints about the return to office.
12/2/2021 10:32,Bring on the 4th 👋
12/2/2021 10:31,everything is grerrible.
12/2/2021 10:31,50% breakthrough rate is below the minimum emergency use criteria. Yikes.
12/2/2021 10:30,"People with COVID-19 are most contagious a few days before they show symptoms, if they become symptomatic at all. Many contagious individuals will not have any symptoms. So the most contagious people will be going about their lives normally while most infective (while showing no outward signs of being diseased)."
12/2/2021 10:30,"Anecdotally, have known a few double vaccinated people who have tested positive who were not going to get tested as they had super mild symptoms so thought it was not covid. Then news of the new variant so they went."
12/2/2021 10:30,Yes but one HAS to be aware of how this statement is interpreted when you hear it.
12/2/2021 10:29,13. Do they hodl Dogecoin?
12/2/2021 10:29,"There is something weirdly humorous about it...I feel like the depressed/exasperated/trapped-indoors guy hoping to see a pleasant scene outside at least but WHAM! there's COVID, right up in his face for the nineteenth month in a row, all day, every day. I had to laugh a little. 😄"
12/2/2021 10:28,"Omicron will spread everywhere and everyone will be exposed to at least on variant of covid regardless of what is done. This is a fact. Closures, travel bans, etc don't work. What works are vaccines, testing and mask wearing."
12/2/2021 10:28,That youtube video of his talk on this is a real good watch
12/2/2021 10:28,"As a a norwegian, reading that article, from the context it means ""some of them"" not one person."
12/2/2021 10:28,There is nothing it’s all anecdotal. All we know is there’s no evidence and no deaths yet confirmed.
12/2/2021 10:27,"Delta waves mostly saw weekly infections increase 50% week on week. South Africa has seen their numbers go up 300% three weeks in a row. The weekly peaks have been 300 > 900 > 3000 > and today was almost 9,000. It's going to arrive on the world stage *fast*."
12/2/2021 10:26,They are really going to reopen NOW?
12/2/2021 10:26,This is where I'm at. I don't meet the ME/CFS criteria but at no point since I got Covid have I not had a health problem or several to deal with. None have required acute care and I have been able to manage symptoms at home by myself but that doesn't mean it hasn't completely derailed my life.
12/2/2021 10:26,I stand corrected. VG reported something else yesterday but article today says one!
12/2/2021 10:26,"Some concern that fully vaccinated are highly susceptible to the new variant. If that is the case, then it would be reasonable to assume the unvaccinated may be in very big trouble."
12/2/2021 10:24,"Nobody in a 1st world country is forcing people to take it.

On the other hand, businesses absolutely have the right to kick out antivax dumbfucks."

Well, it takes at least two weeks for even tough lockdowns to level off the rate of climb.

So if you say a doubling every two-three days, that's say, 5 doublings before levelling off. 11k > 22k > 44k > 88k > 172k > 344k cases per day.

I doubt they will accept reality until the rate hits 100k per day, which loses them a week in addition. It looks to be India levels of case spikes before this is under control."
12/3/2021 9:15,Yes but there are *anecdotes* that it’s mild in a predominantly young adult cohort. So that pretty much settles it!
12/3/2021 9:14,"Nowadays that's easier because of urgent care.

12/3/2021 9:14,"With vaccinations there is up to 3 times less severe cases.

But with exponential growth you only buy a month extra. 40% of ICU is occupied by covid and they will stop all non urgent care.

It's getting to the point where you simply cannot pay HCWs enough for them to decide its worth it. Slogging through the mentally draining and insane workloads caused by people who couldn't do the bare minimum to protect themselves, I cannot blame nurses and doctors for wanting a break from it. 

I honestly will not be surprised if in the next few months, we see hospitals decide to not take unvaccinated people with covid. It'll either be that, or risk the collapse of the healthcare system as staffing issues go beyond critical."

12/3/2021 9:10,"Of course, but the new variants arise because there are so many infected so as vaccination, herd immunity increases, the number of new variants will decrease.  This virus doesn't mutate as quickly as influenza viruses because it has its own error checking mechanism."
12/3/2021 9:10,"Interesting -- worst in terms of cases or hospitalizations?  Last case wave we had wrecked out medical system, supposedly it was almost all unvaccinated in terms of hospitalized patients.  Our vaccination rate is _way_ lower than 92%."

12/3/2021 9:10,"I didn't say it is more dangerous, but media suggested that it may be much milder than Delta, just because one (1!) doctor said she only saw mild cases (around 20, all young and probably recovered from previous infections).

This could lead to people that are still thinking about vaccination not to do it because they think the natural Omicron infection is just fine."

12/3/2021 9:09,"So how about all those dead people then eh were their cases ""mild"""
12/3/2021 9:08,"yes, you may get a different strain of flu that what you are protected from by the flu shot. You might still also catch a flu variant that is protected by the shot - a vaccine isn't a shield preventing a virus from reaching you.

The vaccine makes it much easier for your body to deal with a flu variant it vaccinates against - reducing the likelihood of developing symptoms and reducing how much you will spread it (by killing it fast and preventing or reducing contagious period, and by reducing symptoms that lead to greater spread, etc.) 

Why are you accusing someone who is correct of spouting idiocy?"
12/3/2021 9:08,"He might. In response to your other comment, he should definitely go in. 

It really just depends on the issues he’s dealing with. Assuming it’s long covid, and he had a mild case before, I’d wager he’ll continue to improve over time (though he needs to be cautious about his health for quite a while.) Since he’s gotten sick from other things since covid, it’ll slow down his healing too. It can sometimes take a few years for someone to get back to a similar level they were at before."
12/3/2021 9:08,"It's only spreading at the same rate as the original covid (D614G so the first variant, lineage B.1) did last spring.  Of course it's summer in Johannesburg, but it's a really dense metro area.  With 80% immune escape it still comes out as less contagious than Delta, not more."

But not everyone was tested because our contact tracing app sucks."
12/3/2021 9:08,Hopefully there will be fewer as those as case counts go down.  Coronaviruses don't mutate as much as influenza they have error correcting proteins.  It's just that when there's \~ a million of currently infected individuals at a time you get mutations.
12/3/2021 9:08,Yes I guess im just making sure you understand that
12/3/2021 9:07,"Really think we can hold two thoughts in our minds at once.

1. The precautionary principle. Limiting travel from places with novel viruses or variants reduces seeding in other populations. This can offer weeks to adopt mitigation options.
2. We must honor those countries and researchers that have made an effort to inform the world. The Chinese researchers that gifted the world the wild type genome on 9 Jan 2020, the South African researchers that identified and sequenced the Omicron variant within days of a outbreak among students in Tshwane.

Travel bans can be a good, offering national health systems time to adapt, but so is ensuring that the nations that first discover novel variants are rewarded for their surveillance efforts.

From the twitter of Tulio de Oliveira, a researcher who helped identify the Omicron variant, it appears the travel bans have also meant that South African diagnostic labs are running very short on critical lab reagents. This would blindfold the world to the best data on how Omicron will effect us. The nations of the global North should be ensuring that nations in the global South that are doing vital research aren't punished for their efforts (with financial aid), and that that research can proceed (with expedited shipments of lab reagents and packaged tests)."

Europe is current at about 27K deaths per week attributed to covid19 (and probably more deaths that will show up in excess death counts). Delta is already causing crisis triaging in some places... adding a worse variant on top of that can't be good. 

But otoh, its no black death killing 1/3rd of the population. Also, its biggest advantage is probably just being different, not better. Its still a good chance it has a lower R0, but just escapes some pre-existing immunity. New vaccines, new infections, etc would fix that. Just delays us getting herd immunity."

To be honest, while there's likely some Omicron community transmission going on,  there's also a pretty large delta wave in the US at the moment, so I don't think your risk profile is that much different from say, two weeks ago. If you decided your risk/benefit ratio was worth it then (with the help of good mitigation strategies like a booster and proper masks), your analysis is still pretty much valid even with Omicron, at this time anyway.

I mean, here’s more evidence: Los Angeles County has had a mask mandate since July, Orange County has had no mask mandate. They’re neighboring counties with identical vaccination rates. And we can clearly see a dramatic difference between the epi curves of [LA](https://www.google.com/search?q=los+angeles+county+coronavirus+stats&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&hl=en-us&client=safari) and [Orange](https://www.google.com/search?q=orange+county+coronavirus+stats&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&hl=en-us&client=safari)!

In seriousness, this is not about being “over” the pandemic.

12/3/2021 8:52,"Most countries sequence a respectable portion of their cases now.  Even poor countries that do not sequence much still do enough that you can be sure ""a surge"" is being driven by a particular variant.   India ""only"" sequences 1,000 cases a week, but if 999 of those are Delta (they are) then you know that Delta is predominant in India.

The issue is entirely different: the sequencing takes weeks to months.  That 99.9% is for early October.  There are 21 sequences for late November from India, all Delta, but this can't give us the same degree of certainty.

With South Africa it's equally  delayed.  Late October is 93% Delta, 5% Beta, and the rest were genomes too damaged to classify.  But it's only 100 total sequences for the two-week period, compared to 1000 per 2 weeks further back, because sequences are delayed.  By early November it's 25% Omicron 64% Delta, and by late November 88% Omicron 12% Delta.  These numbers aren't a perfect picture because of preferential sequencing of S dropouts (PCR screening for omicron lets them sequence more cases that they expect to be Omicron), but it shows that Omicron spread was *extremely* low prior to the start of November, with 120/120 sequences not being Omicron.  The 95% lower bound would be 3% Omicron at most.

Other countries have far more screening.  The Netherlands has a high rate of travel to South Africa because of language, and faster sequencing turnaround time than many countries. 2416/2416 sequences in early November were Delta.  The United States did 56,000 sequences that have turned around in early November - 2 were Mu, 1 was alpha, a few were unintelligible (listed as ""others"", this happens when the genome is too damaged to get a maximum likelihood result), and the rest were Delta.  That puts the 95% upper bound confidence interval on Omicron cases during that interval as 0.0065%.  There were 1.1M positive tests during that time interval and possibly 3x that many infections, giving a 95% upper bound of 216 Omicron infections.

Omicron hasn't been spreading under us while we weren't looking.  It's been spreading *faster than we can count*.  It's been rising in prevalence (both by case counts and sewage counts) 5-fold per week in South Africa, in an environment of high immunity and flat Delta cases.  And until we find out otherwise it's a very strong bet that it's doing that everywhere else too.

But the fact that it isn’t even remotely acknowledge in the greater media that there is a notable risk and plenty of unknowns baffles me. Your ignorance to that is also shocking. There are articles on how the vaccines is messing with women’s menstrual cycles. Which means it’s affecting hormones. 

Also, these vaccines are no longer effective against the variants. And the timelines haven’t been quick enough to keep up with the rate this thing is spreading causing new variants to pop up.

But you knew all that right since you are so educated in the topic. Vaccines totally “safe” and “effective”. So effective in fact that we still want everyone to walk around with masks and social distance. Yea, I get that vaccines aren’t 100% effective. But even at the 96% or whatever the effectiveness is claimed to be, still shouldn’t be seeing the rates even continuing to follow the distancing and mask measures. Something doesn’t add up clearly. And then follow up news stories acknowledging the vaccine loses effectiveness significantly over a small period of time for the variants.

This vaccine is now completely useless. And an unnecessary additional risk to add to my life in my opinion. They didn’t roll it out quick enough. Even then it is naive to pretend you’d ever have 100% of your world population vaccinated.

I’ve had both alpha and delta variants. When I got sick with the delta being unvaccinated, it was one day of sniffles and that was it. Cant discount natural immunity. Also, I 100% got the delta from a vaccinated individual.

Feel free to inject yourself up to your eyeballs my friend. Just ignorant."

12/3/2021 8:44,"Good points, I have had the argument about sterilizing immunity with legitimate scientists, I am no scientist, much less a virologist. It's a nowhere argument that gets lost in definitions and is unfortunately used by some as a last resort argument to justify their hesitancy on vaccines.I highly recommend listening to Professor Vincent Racaniello. He has been a virologist for over 40 years, he has been doing podcasts about viruses since podcasts were a thing (over a dozen years). He doesn't monetize his content other than to use donations to fund his streaming setup. He is an excellent and most importantly trustworthy resource. Look up his weekly podcast called TWiV (this week in virology) or ask him questions directly on his weekly Q&A (wednesdays, everything is on youtube).

From listening to the good professor I can say that when they were developing these vaccines they were hoping for maybe 50% effectiveness and that would have been acceptable. We ended up with vaccines that are \~90% effective. I would imagine that polio has many differences from Sars-CoV-2 and Prof. Racaniello could probably ellaborate on that. Though through a quick search polio's main goal is to reach the bloodstream through the lungs or gut, so preventing it reaching the bloodstream would effectively make it non threatening. Whereas Sars-Cov-2 only needs to reach the lungs. Just a wild guess though, these things are vastly complicated and it would take like, 40 years of experience to understand it all I'm sure."

Hospitalizations in Gauteng are doubling each week, which resembles the original delta and alpha outbreaks in infection and vaccine naive populations. 

2. 1 single infected vaccinated person spread it to 60 other vaccinated people at a meeting in Norway. We will see if they get really sick or not. I truly hope not as that would mean at least protection from severe illness."

12/3/2021 8:31,"The article, and one that it links to, says to boost.  The spike protein provokes antibodies to lots of the surface.  Some omicron mutations may keep antibodies to sticking to those places, but other antibodies may be able to stick to less-mutated or un-mutated places.  Those antibodies may provoke the immune system to attack and kill the virus.  If a US football / rugby metaphor helps: sure, you'd like to have a great clean tackle straight on.  But even grabbing a ball-carrier by the arm may be able to bring them down, or may slow them down enough for other tacklers to finish the job.

One of those articles also says that T-cells are harder to fool."

12/3/2021 8:20,Of course it's evolution. Every random error in the virus genome  becomes subject to fitness test by natural selection. Mutations that makes virus more fit stay in the virus genome and are passed to new generations. In an immunocompromised individual selection pressure makes mutations that are even so slightly favour immune escape more favorable.

How much it has increased is one of several billion dollar questions."
12/3/2021 8:17,But we’re they boosted or had they gotten vaxxed more than 6 months ago and maybe waning immunity?  The one guy in MN who caught omicron so far was boosted early Nov and got omicron probably last week.  Mild case but right through a full vaccine strength.

According to [this article](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/09/sterilizing-immunity-myth-covid-19-vaccines/620023/), the idea of ""sterilizing immunity"" that completely prevents infection is sort of a myth, but that's partly because there isn't really a well-defined lower limit to what qualifies as an ""infection"":

>To show sterilizing immunity, researchers have to demonstrate that an infection never occurred—a big ask, considering that microbiologists can’t even agree on what an infection actually is. An onslaught of pathogens ravaging the airway or gut certainly counts. But according to some experts, so does a single viral particle commencing the process of copying itself inside a cell. 

Even if you define a very limited number of viral reproduction cycles in the body to be an ""infection"", aren't there some vaccines where, assuming a vaccinated person is exposed to a ""typical"" viral load, in the vast majority of cases a person's immune system will wipe out the virus before it's reproduced to the point where they develop any noticeable symptoms? For example, the chart [here](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-pfizer-coronavirus-vaccine-compares-other-vaccines-2020-11) compares the effectiveness of different vaccines and the top one is the polio vaccine which is said to have 99% effectiveness."

This is what I was responding to. This is not true. 

The Israeli study of South African data clearly stated that there was a 2.4x chance of severe illness for unvaccinated people, **but they were including people with 2 mRNA shots in this data. They only considered people with a booster shot to be vaccinated.**

And even then, they still found that 10% of people with booster shots were still getting severe illness. 

Of course 90% protection against severe illness for people with booster shots is good, but that still means 10% of fully vaccinated + boosted people are getting severely sick from Omicron. So the implication that vaccinated people only get mild symptoms is completely false."

But here's the thing - there's more of a risk to my 4 year old driving him to and from school 2.5 miles away than there is from coronavirus. If we want to protect our kids, we have to focus our energy where it makes the biggest impact.

You can skip this if you agree with the risk assessment. If you don't agree with that risk assessment, here's the numbers. There have been 630 pediatric deaths in the United States from Covid over the past 21 months in a population of about 73 million, meaning that particular risk is 0.0005% per child per year. Deaths per 100 million vehicle miles travelled is around 1 (it varies based on your state). Comparing those two means that the risk is equitable when driving your child 500 miles per year. So when my son travels 5 miles a day for 180 school days, he takes a bigger risk than he does from covid. And yes, this is a bit of a simplification - it doesn't look at injury/morbidity, only fatalities - but such simplification impacts both sides of the equation, and the data for those complexities is much harder to find.

Can you drive your child 500 miles less in a year? You can have more of a positive impact on them if you do than if you were to somehow completely remove the threat of Covid to them, and you wouldn't have to break the law to do it."

12/3/2021 7:51,Shouldn't that 45% of unvaccinated number come down as people get their shots or ... well.. die off?  Surprised it is still so high
12/3/2021 7:50,"I would say more ""contagious"" is pretty much certain at this point, what remains to be seen is whether this is because it is more tranmissible (how easy it is for one person to infect another), or because it is good at escaping immunity (infecting vaccinated and/or recovered people). It could be either, or a combination of both. 

More dangerous is less clear, altough some early optimism seems to now be more cautious waiting. Severe cases lags behind infection, so we will know more in two or three weeks. 

Regarding precautions, getting a booster is pretty much universally considered the absolute best thing you can do. I'm not sure what you are currently doing, but upgrading masking to N95s for a while might be considered, as can avoiding settings that are at odds with the aerosol nature of the virus, such as restaurants."

Nope sorry, this totally implicates the loss of every last bit of protection and a reversion to immunological naivety among those with prior infection but who are unvaccinated (which, mind you, is huge swathes of the Global South with limited access to vaccines and with governments and healthcare systems that have a much harder time distributing the doses).

If they don't get flu shots at their age, I don't know what to tell you, except maybe you could console yourself on potential inheritance. I don't mean that to sound harsh and sarcastic. Some older people just live their lives and whatever takes them out at whatever age, they are okay with that.

12/3/2021 7:37,"it's really amazing because only this time last year we were getting initial clinical data for our ""gen 1"" mrna vaccines.

to have this type of medical intervention being brought to bear feels miraculous. yes- it's the combined work of thousands of scientists, doctors, and overworked postdocs, but to be able to live in such a time and witness it is remarkable and sometimes it does feel like a miracle."

12/3/2021 7:37,"Very familiar with those studies (and had my 3rd dose last month) but they don’t demonstrate what you think they do. Antibody levels are not efficacy. There is no meaningful difference in VE against symptomatic Covid when comparing the 2 month data from the RCTs vs after the 3rd dose. And by the way the initial 95% VE from 3rd dose in israel is now down to about 90%.   


Strong proponent of booster for everyone, but I would not try to oversell it as having higher efficacy than the amazing efficacy seen soon after the 2nd dose. It should last much longer however."
12/3/2021 7:37,What a fucking joke of a comment. What will it take for people to realize that stopping covid from spreading is not possible? Australia was in full lockdown for almost 2 years and they are currently experiencing their worst outbreak since this shit started. Mandates don't work. Every single person on this planet will eventually get covid if they haven't already. Do whatever you need to do to protect yourself and move the fuck on.
12/3/2021 7:36,It's mild though if you have boosters.
12/3/2021 7:36,"It can, although the damage done from mild cases isn’t likely to result in death; but it certainly can cause long term issues. 

It sounds like your friend may be dealing with long covid symptoms- there’s a huge variety of symptoms people are dealing with, and a moderately “compromised” immune system is one of them. For many, it just may be that their body is still healing, even months later, and it can leave them weaker and more susceptible to issues in the mean time. Long term damage from various viruses can take incredibly long to heal, even when it’s not obvious.

All those ""Cases are connected to South Africa"" are the same thing, sequencing is just fast tracked for people with history of travel."

12/3/2021 7:34,"I disagree that the title is ""horrifically bad"". Can argue about whether or not severe disease or infection is what vaccines are intended to be defend against - they do both. Regardless, prior infection doesn't defend against reinfection as it did in the past or vaccination. Long covid, and significant increase in all cause mortality should be reason to take infection seriously when there is an option to increase defense against it."
12/3/2021 7:33,"This is so poetical, I love it. But it could also describe falling in love, and just life in general.

12/3/2021 7:33,"You're not wrong but Covid is so high up on the people's and the government's agenda that they are looking for as much protection as possible and all focus is on that and not a lot else. I don't think many of us will have ever seen anything with quite the impact of Covid.

Double vaccinated people are still required to wear masks in public as an added assurance, if I were to hazard a guess I suspect that many of the places requiring vaccinated people to show a negative test will be venues where mask wearing isn't practical such as bars and restaurants, so the negative test gives comfort to customers whilst they aren't wearing a mask."

I miss the chance to take my team out to lunch and listen to them 1-on-1 more directly. 

Lots of studies show that most people like hybrid. I think it’s a great balance. 

Edit: because apparently I need to be painfully obvious: once it’s safe and assuming people feel comfortable given the level of endemicity and individual risk at a given time. There? Clear enough?

You shouldn’t be forced back. MY preference once it’s “just” endemic is hybrid."

12/3/2021 7:32,"Can’t get a shot for two weeks where I live, all booked."
12/3/2021 7:32,"You're not alone, that's for sure. I know some people, who still refuse to get even the first shot, because of their own beliefs. They tend to be the ones, who believe in misinformation and trust their immune systems to be healthy enough to fight the virus. 

Even ones, who got infected, think their (if it's still there) anti-bodies can fight off another virus. They will still refuse to get the vaccine out of long term effect fears (which make no sense) or myocarditis (which is treatable if you know it is treatable). 

Then, with the ones, who got their two shots, they have trauma from the short term side effects so that is understandable. It will require a lot of effort or confidence to convince them that the two shots' efficiency wanes over time. My mom got Moderna (without any side effects), but when she learned that I got my booster of Pfizer (as that was my two shots in May), she got worried thinking that putting more vaccine shots in the body can be dangerous. 

She clearly is reading on misinformation on the internet from family/friends, and that's out of my hands. Even if I tell her that the vaccine actually leaves your body after 24 hours leaving behind the spike proteins (basically food), not sure that is enough to sway her. When she comes back from abroad, I can only hope to encourage her to get her booster when her six months have passed.

Good luck with your side of family/friends. There is a point where we may have to give up on some since misinformation has become their truth."

The covid vaccine is very protective vs serious and moderate Illness and quite protective va mild Illness. Getting the flu vaccine does not offer the same protections against influenza.

However, in the unvaccinated it’s pretty clear that covid is the more severe illness. Because of this I worry about the elderly and throes with weakened immune systems"

12/3/2021 7:29,What you describe is a Hypothesis. It would need to be born out in studies and real world data. There are no studies or data that support this hypothesis.
12/3/2021 7:29,"Isn't that the suspicion tho, that we work more on soothing symptoms and maintaining long term dosing, than actually creating cures..."
12/3/2021 7:29,"Okay. 

First off, take the booster, it WILL protect against Omicron, no credible scientist claims otherwise. 

Second, antibodies are not the only part of this equation. Tcells and bcells WILL recognize covid in any of its variants because the core of the virus is the same. Since these cells don't target the spike protein, the vaccines will give them the road map to fight this variant. Now will the vaccine prevent it from even infecting you? Who knows but you WILL be protected with this booster against Omicron."
12/3/2021 7:29,"Not too surprising, plasma antibody counts from previous infections are tiny compared to vaccine-elicited antibodes.  If the Omicron spike is indeed more difficult for antibodies to attach to, as scientists say is likely, that would mean previously infected have a significant chance of reinfection... _however_, that could be of low consequence if the resulting disease is either not present or mild.  If the resulting disease is inconsequential, the net effect may actually be positive if reinfection elicits a stronger antibody response such as we're seeing with vaccine boosters.

I have a history of being too positive with this f'ing virus, but today I am hoping this is just one more step towards a low-virulence, endemic state... as in the end game."
12/3/2021 7:29,"This could lead to dire consequences if you end up infecting someone older with the variant and the reality of it is the worse case scenario, so yea get the booster, wear a mask, protect the people around you but this is not the time to be careless"

I understand that there is real concern for Covid in children, but as a teacher- this was my fear all along. Even now, where I live (not in the US, obviously), bars and restaurants are wide open but schools are still closed. Children are getting the worst of this pandemic and I do worry for our future.

 The one thing I try to keep in mind is that perhaps we need to shift our thinking (as someone in the article states) from kids being “behind” to just being where they are because of a worldwide pandemic. I can’t imagine the stress that is being put on teachers right now to “catch kids up” and I can tell you- it’s not going to happen anytime soon. The kids who are the furthest “behind” before Covid are the ones who are most affected by far- the rich kids had private teachers and parents who could stay home to support them. It’s a mess."

12/3/2021 7:26,"Hello- my husband, 4 year old, and I traveled to Iceland back in September. We used the BinaxNow proctored test from EMed in order to test before returning back to the US (also flew from/ back to Chicago). The requirement was 72 hours prior to departure but we were traveling in pretty remote areas with limited access to testing centers during our testing window (if we had problems, our back-up was to go back to Reykjavik early to get tested at a clinic). Thankfully, we were able to test at a remote camping site, in the back of our campervan, & the process went smoothly (hooray for buying an added WIFI/hotspot device for our camper and if you want to see how small/remote of a place we took our test- it was the Olafsvik Campsite.:))! 
I am currently seeing in Travel Iceland Facebook groups that this is one of the best recommendations going forward to satisfy the new 24 hour changes for US-based travelers. As a precaution, we bought an extra test for each of us (so 6 tests, but ended up needing only 3). You do have to download an app called Navica to be guided by a proctor and to download results, but it was a pretty straightforward process. Hope this helps and best of luck!"

And I'm not saying it's effective, I'm saying that we need to get trustable studies done in America that are transparent so we can answer that question because if someone was holding a gun to your grandma's head and someone else said ""I can stop that bullet with this magic powder"" you would laugh at them but if they said ""I can stop that bullet with this magic powder and I've done it thousands of times and can reproduce the results"" and say ... okay hold up, let me look at this."

12/3/2021 7:03,"Third dose brings efficacy against infection far higher than the second dose.  This is easily measured by antibodies ([here](https://investors.modernatx.com/static-files/c43de312-8273-4394-9a58-a7fc7d5ed098) or [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01527-y)) and also by real world data ([here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.07.21264626v1) shows 95%+ efficacy against Delta after the third dose, at least a 2x risk reduction versus [after the second dose](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2108891)).

""Full effectiveness in 2 weeks after 2nd dose"" is the primary endpoint in the original trials (chosen before the trials started, and a good target point).  Nearly all change in incidence against wildtype, driven by antibodies, happened 1-2 weeks after the first dose (cumulative incidence curves [here](https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download) and [here](https://www.fda.gov/media/144434/download)).

We know that protection against infection (antibody-driven) declines over time after the second dose, but protection against severe disease if infected (T/B-cell driven) continues to rise for months afterwards.  Thus the original decline remains hidden for a while.  Third doses should raise both these values quite significantly (but we can't easily measure it because the number of infections after third doses is so low).

Off topic, but - get your third dose."

We know nothing about protection against severe disease, and further down, the article acknowledges this, but most people don't read past headlines, fewer still past the beginning of the article. There's also no real data about how immunity from vaccination is going to hold up; it's certainly very plausible that at least two-dose immunity is going to be hit to a similar degree. 

>A past coronavirus infection appears to give little immunity to the new Omicron variant rippling across the globe, South African scientists warned on Thursday, potentially tearing away one layer of defense that humanity has won slowly and at immense cost.

It’s when you get millions infected that even just a small percentage of them is a big number. Also remember hospitalization is a lagging indicator- mild disease the first week become severe disease the second week in some people. South Africa hospitalization rate is increasing.
12/3/2021 6:49,Does this mean that the vaccine won’t be effective either? Couldn’t read the article because it’s behind a paywall.

12/3/2021 6:49,"""CARSON CITY, Nev. -- Nevada will be the first state to charge state workers enrolled in public employee health insurance plans a surcharge if they aren't vaccinated.

The state Public Employees' Benefit Program Board voted on Thursday to charge unvaccinated workers up to $55 per month to offset the costs of testing those who haven't gotten shots are required to undergo in certain workplaces.""

The main issue is that if you feel like manure, the booster may make you feel even worse.

12/3/2021 6:42,"Good explanation. Now check this out: https://twitter.com/trvrb/status/1465364311048478725

Specifically see [this cool graph](https://twitter.com/trvrb/status/1465364317931393025/photo/1). Omicron may not actually have a higher R0 than Delta. It may just be better at finding hosts within a population of immune individuals. If true, within a totally naive population Delta would spread faster, but now that most of the world has some immunity either from vaccinations or prior infections, Omicron is the clear winner.

This may also mean it will continue to spread in areas where Delta fizzled out due to lack of easy to find hosts (which Omicron finds just fine). :/ Not good..."
12/3/2021 6:41,I was at the con. I had to walk out of a training session for work and get tested. I also had to scrap my fun Thursday evening plans. I'm not worried--I'm boosted and I feel great--I'm more pissed about missing The New Pornographers than anything.

12/3/2021 6:39,"But Aaron Rodgers is all good to go, seems fair"
12/3/2021 6:39,One way to attenuate a virus is passing it thru different animal hosts - this is how classic live-attenuated vaccines were developed. I really hope this holds true to “milder” virus in humans theory.
12/3/2021 6:39,My brother isn’t. I’ve told him the risks. I’ve told him to get the damn shots. But he won’t.
12/3/2021 6:38,"I would hardly say nothing changed with Delta. Vaccine mandates and the expansion of boosters throughout the fall *were* all major changes directly in response to Delta. The number people getting their first doses increased after dropping all summer. ICUs did run out of beds. A lot of people died and were hospitalized (mostly unvaccinated) who didn't need to.

Locally, some antivaxxer murdered a pharmacist and his wife in my city. Counties around here brought mask mandates back. Some major concert venues started making people show vaxx cards.

It is true that if you and most of your family and friends were all fully vaccinated, and you didn't need to go to the hospital for anything else, or were working in health care dealing with all this, daily life was pretty normal.

If you mean lockdown and capacity restrictions, no, I don't think we'll see more of those."
12/3/2021 6:38,"I think it is safe to conclude that Omicron is not 'mild' as proposed and hoped by many.

How can we conclude that? It being far better at spreading among populations with some immunity does not mean it is more dangerous to individuals. It certainly may be, but solid evidence on that front is still lacking."
12/3/2021 6:38,"Good thing I am fully vaccinated, had COVID recently, AND got my booster."
12/3/2021 6:38,"Do you have a link to the excess death stats ? I assumed the younger population fought off delta despite the low vaccination rate; though its always a mystery to me how the high HIV rate plays into all of this

[https://www.samrc.ac.za/reports/report-weekly-deaths-south-africa](https://www.samrc.ac.za/reports/report-weekly-deaths-south-africa)

12/3/2021 6:38,You know it would be easier to just get an officiant!
12/3/2021 6:38,From what I remember yes the first ones detected in South Africa were young. Average age of the country isn't relevant here though. Average age is usually driven down by infant mortality and is not a reflection of how many 60-70 year olds a country has in proportion.
12/3/2021 6:38,"How about we let all of the unvaccinated doctors & nurses treat the unvaccinated covid patients at separate hospital like facilities?

OR... unethical opinion... just turn them away. They made their choice. They weren't scared of the 99% survival rate."

12/3/2021 6:36,"Look I get it. Pandemic has hit many hard. But pressing the panic button is never a solution. Last time we had this shit, there were lines in grocery stories with no toilet paper as if the Virus was giving people the shits. 

I do agree with 'plan for the worst' however the media and news outlet are literally pouring fuel on the fire with unsubstantiated data. I really don't think enforcing lockdowns and shutting down the gates on travel is a solution here. Better testing both in and out at major airports and faster vaccine deployments is what can be relied on. Kneecapping the economy again for a thing that might be around for a while isn't gonna be a long term solution. What happens if the world goes in another lockdown with Omnicron and we deal with it for 6 months only to have another variant pop up? This shit isn't sustainable."
12/3/2021 6:36,This doesn’t sound like a good idea. Just my two cents.
12/3/2021 6:35,"Yea, I agree, but the inconvenience + loss of PTO + presence of a lot of other viruses right now is making it harder to expect people to freeze their lives at any sniffle.  It's the right thing to do, but it's not feasible for people to just wait around for a PCR result.  I hope that we get some sort of rapid testing program like the NHS implemented for schoolchildren soon because it would probably make a difference.  Rapids aren't perfect but they're better than nothing."
12/3/2021 6:35,Tingly
12/3/2021 6:35,Too soon.
12/3/2021 6:35,Wait… The Senate is open to the public for comments?
12/3/2021 6:35,"The ""sky is falling"" people were equally useless at the start of the pandemic.  They generally undermined the message about vaccinations, and in some cases amplified the voices of the early antivaxxers / covid herders by suggesting that vaccination might be impossible.

And there has to be a path towards some kind of hope for people to follow the advice of experts.  The vaccine efficacy against severe disease and hospitalization is likely to be durable in the face of any variant.  There's good reason to assume that no variant will ever be able to escape the T-cells that the immune system builds once a sufficiently robust immune response has been achieved.  It isn't useful to dilute that message by assuming the worst that this virus will change all the rules and reset the clock to back to 2019 with some variant.  We really need to stop assuming that is going to happen every single time.

Worst-casing the pandemic without any immunological or epidemiological basis undermines any faith/hope that we'll get out of the pandemic, and that actually reinforces antivaxxer messages which undermines the whole path forwards.  There really is a ""horseshoe effect"" where people can wind up being so pessimistic that it is counter-productive."
12/3/2021 6:35,Some lag in comcast and you cut the dick off instead of the vasectomy
12/3/2021 6:34,True.. It wouldn’t have matter if a quadruple vaccine was touted at first.
12/3/2021 6:34,"Okay, thank you. Our plan is to get a test as close to the 24 hour window is possible, maybe get one too early. I’d rather have a test to present than nothing at all. And I will get some of those rapid tests too, didn’t know those existed."
12/3/2021 6:34,"Yeah, 20% is still like 17 million people who could potentially have a bad infection."

12/3/2021 6:25,Yup.  I would not expect a specific booster to ever happen.
12/3/2021 6:25,"Yes, vaccinations do little to prevent infection. They give your immune system information to identify the virus. So you get infected and the virus starts replicating in the upper nasal tract, your immune system recognizes it right away and either the antibodies that are still there from your recent vaccination get to work or your memory B cells start firing up to produce new antibodies. That means the virus is (hopefully) taken out before it has the chance to infect the lower respiratory tract. Most of the damage from covid is from your own immune system overreacting once the virus poses a threat to the respiratory system (cytokine storm). So while those vaccinated may get infected they will likely spread for a much shorter time and may not even notice the infection and almost certainly avoid the ICU.

Immunity is such a bad word for what these vaccines do. Think of all the stories of native tribes with no contact with industrial civilization that were wiped out because they had no immune system protection from common colds and the like. Every human on Earth is a native tribe member as far as covid is concerned and unless you've been vaccinated or recovered from previous infection you are at significant risk of serious outcome. Novel means new, you have antibodies for the common cold straight from your mother since you were born. No one has any protection from Sars-CoV-2 prior to late 2019."

A sad vaccine story: 

11/21/1736  
Franklin Loses Son  
Benjamin Franklin’s four-year-old son, Francis Folger Franklin, died of smallpox on November 21, 1736.  
Rumors began to circulate claiming that the boy had been inoculated. Franklin published a denial and advocated inoculation.  
“In 1736 I lost one of my Sons, a fine Boy of 4 Years old, taken by the Small Pox in the common way. I long regretted that I had not given it to him by Inoculation, which I mention for the Sake of Parents, who omit that Operation on the Supposition that they should never forgive themselves if a Child died under it; my Example showing that the Regret may be the same either way, and that therefore the safer should be chosen.”  
— Benjamin Franklin, quoted in Franklin on Franklin by Paul Zall

&#x200B;

Or if Mom thinks there hasn't been enough testing, try this story out for size as an example of just going for it without testing. 

1774  
A Farmer Takes a Chance  
Benjamin Jesty (1737-1816), English farmer and cattle breeder, inoculated his wife and two sons with matter from a cowpox lesion on one of his cows.  
Jesty, having already contracted cowpox, believed himself protected from smallpox infection. When a serious smallpox epidemic hit his Dorset village, he, from his “great strength of mind,” took it upon himself to protect his family. His wife and children survived, and the boys, when challenged with smallpox inoculation in 1789, showed no symptoms. Jesty, however, had no interest in systematically testing his methods or publishing his results, and so his finding was largely forgotten. Upon his death, Jesty’s wife had his tombstone inscribed, “the first person (known) who introduced the cow-pox inoculation.”"
12/3/2021 5:56,"> The social media posts started in May: photos and videos of smiling people, mostly women, drinking Mason jars of black liquid, slathering black paste on their faces and feet, or dipping babies and dogs in tubs of the black water. They tagged the posts #BOO and linked to a website that sold a product called Black Oxygen Organics.
> 
> Black Oxygen Organics, or “BOO” for short, is difficult to classify. It was marketed as fulvic acid, a compound derived from decayed plants, that was dug up from an Ontario peat bog. The website of the Canadian company that sold it billed it as “the end product and smallest particle of the decomposition of ancient, organic matter.” 
> 
> Put more simply, the product is dirt — four-and-a-half ounces of it, sealed in a sleek black plastic baggie and sold for $110 plus shipping. Visitors to the Black Oxygen Organics website, recently taken offline, were greeted with a pair of white hands cradling cups of dirt like an offering. “A gift from the Ground,” it reads. “Drink it. Wear it. Bathe in it.” 
> 
> BOO, which “can be taken by anyone at any age, as well as animals,” according to the company, claims many benefits and uses, including improved brain function and heart health, and ridding the body of so-called toxins that include heavy metals, pesticides and parasites. 

>By the end of the summer, online ads for BOO had made their way to millions of people within the internet subcultures that embrace fringe supplements, including the mixed martial arts community, anti-vaccine and Covid-denier groups, and finally more general alternative health and fake cure spaces.

Skipping ahead a bit:

>But success came at a price. Canadian and U.S. health regulators have cracked down on BOO in recent months, initiating recalls and product holds at the border, respectively. And just as an online army of fans powered BOO’s success, an oppositional force of online skeptics threatened to shut it down. 

>Just before Thanksgiving, the company announced in an email it was closing up shop for good. Sellers packed video calls mourning the death of their miracle cure, railing against executives who had taken their money and seemingly run, and wondering how they might recoup the thousands of dollars they paid for BOO that never arrived."

12/3/2021 5:55,I really doubt any country has 80-90% infected. I understand they measure antibodies and estimate but Im pretty skeptical about it
12/3/2021 5:54,"I know this is me just probably projecting and trying to make sense of things, but despite being vaxed since May and one of the more careful people I know, I suddenly got smacked with it right at Thanksgiving. And this is after a month or two back taking care of my mom while she had it, and while we were careful, it was still surprising I never even got a sniffle. So for this to come out of nowhere and get me pretty sick for about 5 days makes me wonder if it could be this omicron variant

Who knows though. Probably just ol Delta finally wore my vaccine down"
12/3/2021 5:54,"I have a theory, admittdly with no proof, that mostly people who wear masks yet still get covid got it because they went to a public bathroom and used a hand dryer at some point. Yes covid lives in the air, but hand dryers takes that air and blows it onto your hands."
12/3/2021 5:54,"he’s talking about the guy in the thumbnail, antonio brown. he’s a messed up dude, started calling himself mister big chest (MBC) a few years back which spawned a bunch of joke acronyms"

The more we learn the more clear it becomes that vaccination is an overwhelmingly positive benefit to you and everyone around you.  Protect your family, your parents, your coworkers, your teachers, and yourself.  Get your first dose."

It's great, the office is 10 minutes from my house and most days I'm one of 2 or 3 people in the office.

I think that the requirement was put in place to shut up our legislature, because they also count working in the field as being in the office.

12/3/2021 5:51,"It's a matter of where you shift the tests to. You can dilute the positivity rate by doing a lot of routine testing of healthy workers, for example. And in most countries, people with ""just a sore throat"" aren't all that bothered to run out and get swabbed. If there's a concerted effort to get people to see a doctor or go get swabbed with the slightest of symptoms, or if there are rules that all patients visiting a clinic with cold-like symptoms get swabbed, and meanwhile routine testing of healthy workers is reduced, the positivity rate goes up.

Or if there's mass distribution of antigen rapid tests, and those with positive rapid test results are encouraged/compelled to get PCR swabbed and are not allowed to just self-isolate at home.

And targeted testing of household members of positive cases."

12/3/2021 5:44,*Clap mother fucking clap*
12/3/2021 5:44,"I'd boost now. It will be months before they adapt the vaccine, if at all."
12/3/2021 5:43,Not necessarily. South Africa had one of the lowest cases around the world. So it’s more visible.

12/3/2021 5:42,It was found in a sample from October in Nigeria. That is pretty far from southern Africa
12/3/2021 5:42,This is a horrible attitude to have. My friend (40) had a kidney transplant - yes they are boosted but covid could kill them.  When they checked their antibodies they were on the low end. We can’t just throw our arms up and say well good luck.  People should rapid test before gathering maskless indoors. People should wear a mask. Get vaccinated. Be smart. Keep doing what you can to save others even if you yourself will be fine.
12/3/2021 5:42,Why wait?
12/3/2021 5:42,"Friend of mine tripped and broke her wrist while in France. She knew it was broken immediately and a woman nearby, who had seen her trip, said, ""Wait"". She called the Emergency Medics, who arrived within 10 minutes. As this was a small village, the ambulance transported her and her husband to a larger town about 30 miles away. She was seen by a doctor, images were taken, and the doctor said, ""We need to do surgery to secure the bones."" She spent the night in the hospital, had surgery first thing the next morning, and was discharged. The doctor asked for her travel itinerary, and scheduled a followup appointment for her in another city to have it rechecked, stitches removed, and get a removable cast. In the meantime, he emailed her several times to inquire how she was doing. You know what they didn't do? The didn't give her a giant bottle of opiates. But for everything else, start to finish, her bill was just under $2,000 (not Euros). DAMN SOCIALISTS!"

How someone hasn’t figured out a program to send everyone dozens of tests to keep at home is beyond me. I get the binax ones for $14 from Walmart and have a large stash but they are frequently out of stock, and $14 isn’t affordable to many. 

More testing wouldn’t stop the pandemic but it is one of many mitigation strategies that are not being used to their full capabilities."

12/4/2021 10:41,"Yes I like to discuss covid measures on Reddit, but if you actually look, you'll see plenty of comments on other things too. Moreover the covid measures posts are clearly pro vaxx.

I mean you can think whatever you want - but if you label everyone who doesn't agree with you a professional disinformer, then you're up for some surprise when you'll one day realize that not all people around you agree with you either."

At this point, is the goal of not ever contracting COVID even viable anymore without someone becoming a hermit? (I.e. WFH, all groceries/food delivered, only spend time outdoors without coming into close proximity with anyone)

My fear is that unlike most colds or flus, even a mild case of covid will be more likely to permanently weaken your body in subtle ways..."

12/4/2021 10:32,"That’s not how it works at all. This is you’re adaptive immunity at work. Allergies constitute a very distinct type of hypersensitivity, it’s not just histamines = allergies. Just because you are getting an immune response of a hundred fold to one pathogen does not mean you suddenly are more allergic to everything."
12/4/2021 10:31,I think I’ll wait at least another week before taking anything WHO says as fact. Then flip flop often.
12/4/2021 10:29,"What I'm not liking here is the fact that almost every notable case of omicron that's made the news (x person with omicron attended y event) has, a few days later, appeared to result in significant spread.

Before Omicron, the rule of thumb was 80% of the spread was done by 20% of people.  That rule of thumb covered a few issues: (1) unique physicality of that individual (how much they spit while talking, for example); (2) period of high viral load (people are only contagious with SARS-COV-2 during a certain period of time; so even if you 'have' covid, you arent' necessarily contagious; (3) the sociability factor -- how many people that person interacts with.

Based on the cases we're seeing in the news, I'm starting to think that Omicron is more 'transmissible' because it's expanding #'s (1) & (2).  More people are becoming contagious with Omicron than might have been with Delta, OG, etc.; (2) people are contagious for longer than they might have been with previous variants."

But it's been four and half months, we've been living normally and all is still ok."
12/4/2021 10:26,"Oh yeah, except for the part where this virus can and does mutate, and might become more lethal again. So no, it's not necessarily over even if that does happen."
12/4/2021 10:26,"Actually, not necessarily. It's also possible (and more likely) that HIV just picked up the same piece of genetic material from the HCoV common cold variant. 

However, as the article states, it is in fact very likely it evolved in someone with HIV, but not for the reason you think. A person infected with HIV who's left untreated just creates the perfect environment for viruses to meet and exchange DNA or RNA (usually the latter). And South Africa has no shortage of untreated HIV patients."
12/4/2021 10:25,I never said that.  Putting words in another’s mouth is a form of misinformation.

12/4/2021 10:20,"Cytokines are secreted as the body finds and fights the virus, but if the virus ability to replicate is faster than the body fights it off, the body will produce more cytokines at an exponential rate. This constitutes a cytokines storm and it is at a level much higher than a hundred fold. It essentially means the body’s defenses are being overwhelmed and is not really an “over reaction.”"

Of course, these are South African doctors so they worked with the same population with previous strains, except that perhaps due to its higher transmissibility, Omicron is hitting younger groups harder (since they tend to be more socially active)."

The infected people visited the restaurant Louise Restaurant & Bar at Aker Brygge at the same time as the company Scatec held a Christmas table. They are thus in addition to the around 60 Christmas table participants who have already been registered infected. 10 of those infected have been confirmed infected with the omicron variant of corona."

12/4/2021 9:56,It could possibly be that kids really don't show signs of covid until much later and then on top of it whenever they are sick they have a different reaction from covid than adults I believe it's Mis-C which is similar to Kawasaki disease in Japan it's a inflammatory reaction in their body I'm guessing because of the immune response there's probably a better immune response or stronger than an adult would have. I haven't read the article but 29% that is a lot but I don't think that's a percentage of all people infected or children infected it would be those admitted to hospital and when you admit a kid to the hospital they're probably quite ill. I wonder what the percentage is of adults that are admitted to the hospital having severe disease?

12/4/2021 9:54,"what you're saying is correct -- so far it doesn't appear the vaccine will protect against infection. 

however, it also appears cases have been mild for vaccinated and unvaccinated. i don't think we're going to get rocked even if it's highly transmissible.

i think a piece of data we all forget is: covid has already killed nearly one million people in the us. the reason why less people are being hospitalized and dying is because covid has already unfairly claimed many lives of the at-risk population. if the pandemic started with the omicron variant, this would be a much sadder story"

If in the area responsible for symptoms, the the mutation could have done 3 things: 1) Nothing, just extra information, though it could cause issues later, 2)make the symptoms milder, more than likely by suppressing a gene, or 3) make the symptoms worse  by amplifying a gene we react to severely.

But also, given the spread, it's strange...I would think we've dialed down testing almost everywhere so the fact it shows up indicates a strong base. 

I think it's likely more infectious, or it wouldn't have gotten such a foothold. The thing to look out for is whether it's more serious for vaccinated/unvaccinated, and also whether it grants any kind of immunity boost for those infected toward other variants. 

If it becomes highly spread/more common we may see it completely outcompete variants like delta. Which would be the best case scenario, imo, to end the pandemic."
12/4/2021 9:32,"This seems inaccurate in regards to children though as the article is indicating more children are being hospitalized, and more hospitalized children are having severe cases.

Taiwan relies on a quarantine for international travelers arriving, currently 14 days in a quarantine hotel, but soon to be lowered (for fully vaccinated) to 7 days in a hotel and 7 days in a home isolated with no shared space or bathroom (if there is anyone else in the house they must be fully vaccinated and not come in contact. Negative PCR are required to exit quarantine. Violation of quarantine rules subject to a fine as high as $30,000USD.

They make us of contact tracing and isolation for at risk contacts when a new infection is found in the community.

Note that the 30 days is counting ANY domestic covid case regardless of the age of the infection. The last active infection (CT < 30) was September 16 meaning Taiwan has actually gone 79 days of no domestic transmission since the cases since then have all been old infections found during routine testing for other purposes. 

It has been 25 days since a death related to a domestic covid case.

> If only the susceptible wears a face mask with infectious speaking at a distance of 1.5 m, the upper bound drops very significantly; that is, with a surgical mask, the upper bound reaches 90% after 30 min, and, with an FFP2 mask, it remains at about 20% even after 1 h.

Omicron is far more infectious than any variant before.

This leads to a higher total number of children in the hospital as a whole and, due to the worst vaccination rate, to a higher relative rate compared to other age classes. Of course this all also leads to a higher relative number of children, than before.

You can’t just say this without backing it with numbers and data, please.

For example, if all beds are full, the hospitalisation rate will be zero. 

You can’t just take one number and make a conclusion. 

We need more info to make an educated decision, if this is „extreme“ or not!

Look at this article: https://rekord.co.za/400031/tshwane-early-covid-hospital-admissions-mostly-children-under-2-years-and-87-unvaccinated/?pwa-amp&

This is the clear result of Omicron being the most infective variant yet and the children are, due to not being vaccinated at all, the most infected age class. 

Only from „10% in hospitals are children“ you can’t just say, Omicron is taking more children into hospitalisation. It’s more like more children are infected and the rate of hospitalisation might still be the same as before, but since the number of infections are higher as a whole and the rate of unvaccinated people in the age class of children is 0% there are more in the hospital. 

This is more FUD than anything.
Omicron is far more infectious than any variant before.
It rages through all age classes and hits unvaccinated more than others.
100% of all children are unvaccinated and there is more covid cases as a whole than ever before.
This leads to a higher total number of children in the hospital as a whole and, due to the worst vaccination rate, to a higher relative rate compared to other age classes. Of course this all also leads to a higher relative number of children, than before.

And this is, what this article implies, without giving us the correct numbers.

Can you follow that? The key question is, does Omicron send relatively more children into the hospital or not? This article doesn’t answer that!

Edit: Obviously, as I get downvoted, people, once more, can’t follow that and the FUD does it’s work.

So far Omikron is no more dangerous to children, than other variants. One more reason to get vaccinated to protect them by slowing down the spread!"

12/4/2021 8:54,"all vaccines probably provide some broad protection, even getting the flu vaccine slightly helps against covid, the live mmr vaccine does too, whats not mentioned is waning immunity, its been almost 2 years so alot of people who were exposed couldve very well lost their immunity"
12/4/2021 8:51,Pretty sure it was discovered in Botswana before SA.
12/4/2021 8:51,"Children aren't born with HIV, regardless if the mother is + or not. Adults are antivax here and by proxy the children aren't getting vaccinated either. They are sent to school/kindergarten/day cares where proper measures aren't taken.

In rural areas, malnutrition, over-crowding and inadequate sanitation may be the reason. I seldomly see parents masking up their children or sanitizing their hands. Parents are still relying on old data that children are only vectors and aren't really affected by covid. It's not really health conditions (such as illness), it has more to do with their living conditions and what they are exposed to. The antivax movements are ginormous in every socio economic class but for very different reasons. Our impoverished community is convinced that vaccines are subtle ways to 'get rid' of them where our wealthier classes are concerned about control, constitutional rights, religious convictions/prophecies, infertility, side effects, conspiracy and well, death. (thanks YouTube)

We are having an incredibly hard time to get our people to do what is necessary. Our government is threatening to make the vaccine mandatory since we are still technically in lockdown."

12/4/2021 8:51,"> Love that the guy had symptoms for 2 days only.

I had Covid a year ago and it was short duration event. Except for feeling really crappy and running a fever for around one day, it was not unlike respiratory viruses I have had before. I have lost my sense of taste and smell to a virus before.

I think how sick you get has a lot to do with the nature of your exposure. If you are wearing your mask most of the time and only getting a brief whiff of Covid you will be off to a mild disease.

In other words, I am not going to bank much hope that this Omicron is some sort of godsend because it is milder. (Not that you actually said that.)

That would be truly awesome though -  if a milder strain became dominant.

Long story short: I am kind of freaked out by a new strain that is reinfecting people and breaking through vaccinations."

12/4/2021 8:45,"With little or no delay, the public on local and national levels should know what number and what percentage of reported COVID-19 kills in the US and other countries occur in persons not-fully vaccinated or in persons past due for a ""booster shot"", especially in light of the fact 36.5 percent of the U.S. population age ≥ 5 years, or about 31,2129,381, are not fully vaccinated and seem to be helping to extend immensely the duration of the war against COVID-19 and helping to increase the constantly expanding cumulative number of deaths in the US by not getting fully vaccinated.  
                 
This circumstance has helped COVID-19 attain a kill rate equal to one of about every 449 persons in the U.S. population and has helped COVID-19 rack up 783,215 reported kills in the US, all in less than 1 year 11 months.  
            
The number of confirmed COVID-19 kills in the US amounts to more than 15 percent of the 5,242,078 cumulative COVID-19 kills reported on Earth, while the size of the U.S. population today amounts to only about 4 percent of the world population.

12/4/2021 8:43,Yeah I am South African so I can 100% say there are mandates. Whether everyone is adhering to them is a completely different question.
12/4/2021 8:42,This is anecdotal... I was very sick early November 2019 with a cough. A very dry unproductive cough. I'm not in the best shape but I was running everyday to do a half marathon. Since I was an adult I noticed I would have skipped beats. It was diagnosed as PVCS (pre ventricular contractions). One night in late November I am laying in bed waiting for my wife to come home and out of nowhere my heart drops and then races ~170-200 for 10 minutes. I whip out my phone to record the weird phenomenon with a heartbeat app that was successful in recording all my previous episodes of PVCS. I call the next day to make an appointment with my doctor I get an EKG and everything is normal. She refers me to cardiologist anyhow since I already have documented PVCS. Same thing happens a few more times before cardiologist appointment. He schedules me to wear a monitor for 24 hours. He notes a couple skipped beats but nothing out of the ordinary. I advocate for myself and get the monitor you wear for a month. Nothing.... Nothing.... One morning his office calls and tells me to go pick up medication that will help control the rhythm. They call two days later and bumped me to the max dose. My heart was beating normal after that. I do have to go back twice a year but the peace of mind is amazing. I didn't want to do anything because I was afraid the rhythm wouldn't return to normal and I would drop dead. Good luck. I know how bad it sucks. Please advocate for yourself.

My worry is that nearly *half* of Floridians are not vaccinated. Sure, there's certainly a bunch that have had COVID and may have antibodies or T-cells that will prove to shield them, but there is also a population that has not had COVID."

Additionally I get information, like how to deal with patients returning to Canada, what the requirements for flying to International destinations are, and if other states are getting more severe in their requirements. Patients just don't know these things. 

Keeping tabs with the symptoms, mildness or severity of cases is also highly useful, considering that I may be looking an Omicron patient in the face tomorrow."

12/4/2021 8:24,"Jesus Christ. The idea that the existing vaccines are going to provide any meaningful protection at a population level is absolute nonsense. We now have multiple reports of one infected person hanging out with a hundred fully vaccinated individuals and 3 days later a majority of them are testing positive. 

We have cases where an airplane full of tested negative commuters that are fully vaccinated are testing positive shortly after they find out that one of the people on the plane was omicron positive. 

We are now in a position where maybe fully vaccinated people, and those are individuals who are healthy and have two shots plus a booster maybe MAYBE have an increased chance of not winding up in the ICU. 

The world is in such a substantially worse position than we were this time last year, hospitals are full, people are burned out at the idea of spending another winter alone, everyone assumes that the vaccines are working, the immediate response to omicron was that it's mild despite absolutely and I mean zero evidence backing the idea of that omicron is anything other than more severe, and world leaders everywhere are saying that just get the booster and you'll be fine and everything is fine it's all good don't worry about anything.

I have narcolepsy and the current understanding seems to be that a common cause is the immune system fighting off a respiratory virus (say, swine flu) and engaging in a mistaken identity attack resulting in the destruction of hypocretinergic neurons in the hypothalamus. 

Obviously that's far from the only condition caused by the immune system attacking the nervous system, so what gives with that? A defective signaling system preventing the immune system from recognizing those cells?"

Hell, I have been afraid to get an STD test because I was afraid it would be positive, which is... such a weird mental fallacy. 

Everything was negative, FYI.

Anyway. My partner and I decided to just man up and do it after the new variant hit the news.

As is always the case with these sorts of things. The anticipation was the worst part. I scheduled an appointment  for 8 PM at Walmart at 6PM. I wish I could schedule a regular doctor's visit 2 hours out. My partner had to schedule hers for the next day, but I said that maybe Walmart would be cool and give us a 2fer, and they did.  

2 boosters. 10 minutes to set up 2 appointments. Scheduled an appointment 1 hour from the time I made the appointment. Got a 2 for one with my partner. 

The side effects for me were about as bad as the first dose. The second dose really knocked me out, but only for about 2 days.

In Canada, where I live, high vaccine uptake has negated the impact of Delta and brought our deaths down to a manageable level.

12/4/2021 7:26,Every ER RN I've talked to who's picking up extra shifts has said they're only doing it through the winter and once spring hits they're going to take it easy
12/4/2021 7:25,"The differential in rate of spread could account for this, though.  If hospitalizations lag cases by 8 days and Delta doubles in 4 days, then the number of cases you see *now* would be 4x the number of cases that generated those hospitalizations, and you'd undercount the rate by a factor of 4.  If Omicron doubles in 2 days, then the number of cases *now* would be 16x the number that generated the current hospitalizations, and you'd undercount by a factor of 16.  Comparing Delta to Omicron, you'd observe a per-case hospitalization 4x lower for Omicron, simply because the reported number of cases grows faster in the time lag from infection to hospitalization.

Ideally you should compare hospitalizations to reported cases X days ago, where X is the median time between detection and hospitalization.  Hard to do that when the strain is new and you don't know whether the time to hospitalization has changed, though.  If you assume it's similar to the original strain, \~10 days, you should be dividing the number of daily hospitalizations now (\~80) by the number of cases on Nov 22 (312, but it was a weekend, so if you smooth that out \~800).  That doesn't look very good - it's about 10-20%, similar to the original strain before anyone had immunity."

12/4/2021 7:13,"I've been wondering the same thing about my native Bulgaria, where the true death toll is at least 50,000 out of a population of under 7,000,000. So up to 1% of the population has already died. I don't know how the medical system is still functioning at all, and I worry that it'll be crippled for years due to a loss of personnel and a backlog of procedures. 

That being said, even in Bulgaria, which has among the highest Covid-19 death rates in the world, there have been various pandemic control measures put in place, including mandatory masking, social distancing, lockdown and (more recently) vaccine passports. Compliance has gotten very poor due to pandemic fatigue and a complete lack of public trust, but even the most incompetent governments can't afford to let the virus rip through the population unrestrained. In the case of Russia, their vaccination campaign has actually been more successful, although that bar is very low, given that Bulgaria is only ~25% vaccinated.

You have to bear in mind, however, that Eastern Europe generally has an older, less healthy population (on top of a weaker healthcare system), so even with a competent pandemic response, one would expect a higher baseline rate of Covid-19 mortality for these countries. That also implies there could still be many people with no immunity (from vaccination or previous infection) to drive further infection waves. And Omicron will make the situation that much worse, if South Africa is any indication. These countries are destroying themselves."

They are working on “universal vaccines” for both coronaviruses and the flu by targeting regions that are very stable and difficult to mutate. If successful those would be superior. 

As for COVID specifically, I think they targeted the spike protein in part because that’s how it enters cells. It has limitations on how much it can mutate and still effectively enter cells."

The ultimate cause could well be political, and it's been clear from the start that something was off about Russia's numbers because their case fatality rate is too low. It seems to be a case of systematic undercounting rather than manipulation of data after it's been collected.

Edit: Worth noting that Rosstat, Russia's state statistics agency, [reports over 537,000 deaths](https://www.euronews.com/2021/12/03/russia-registers-record-for-monthly-covid-virus-linked-deaths-in-october) by using more inclusive criteria compared to the country's coronavirus task force.

12/4/2021 6:51,"So hard to get a reasonable take of “hey this variant may be more infectious and we should simply use it to encourage further vaccination”.

The virus doesn’t appear to be any more deadly. It also appears that current vaccines seem to work against it. No real need to fear monger OR chalk it up as a nothing burger. It’s a concern that should be addressed through encouraged vaccination but we don’t need to act like it’s apocalyptic."
12/4/2021 6:50,">In this study, we found that a third dose of the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 provided additional protection against detected SARS-CoV-2 infection. Across the test-negative and matched case-control analyses, we estimated an 83% to 87% reduction in the odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 after at least 2 weeks following receipt of the booster compared with receiving 2 doses. These numbers should be interpreted as the reduction in the odds of infection in a person receiving the booster dose compared with a person receiving only the 2 primary doses. This reduction comes on top of the reduction in the risk conferred by the first 2 doses.

12/4/2021 6:44,"I been using data publicly announced from what my data is telling me off of known repetier cases globally before the US had it well the rumors of the 2 week incubation are likely true, so yah odds are people who have it now caught it upwards of 2 weeks ago, this could of easily spread even from going to a base ball game so it ain’t like the con to blame.

The fact cases are showing up that aren’t delta and the fact they can spread to areas that have delta tells me that it out competes Delta I think Delta running outta host at this point that don’t have immunity and well now Omicorn on the rise that is different enough to infect many

Plus Omicorn so different that vaccines don’t prevent infection and likely even allow vaccinated to spread it so it has a bigger population of people it can infect so we are looking at a variant that can quickly use the global population and can easily become another series of variants"

[British Heart Foundation](https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/heart-matters-magazine/news/coronavirus-and-your-health/covid-booster-vaccine#howlong)

> Studies have shown very high protection after one or two weeks after the booster jab. A recent trial by Pfizer suggests that from seven days onwards, a booster dose of Pfizer is extremely effective at preventing illness from Covid-19.

So yes, it does say one *or* two, but based on the trial, I'm going with one.

In any case, my antibody levels will be increased after a week. They most likely won't hit peak until two weeks but something is better than nothing and this appointment was the soonest I could get it."

12/4/2021 6:43,I totally agree. The lockdown restrictions we had were just insane and not backed up by any proof. I was almost sure everyone got to put a stupid suggestion into a hat then every week one of those suggestions were pulled out. The other issue is we had those riots in June or July and businesses cannot afford to close. The economy is so fragile that we need things to remain open.
12/4/2021 6:43,Out of sheer curiosity: What would be a reason to be worried?
12/4/2021 6:43,"FYI there's no actual evidence this is omicron at all if you look at the data South Africa is putting out. They haven't even tested the majority of these patients for COVID at all because they're so resource limited there.

There's just some viral illness that's causing all these hospital admissions for kids and they're *presuming it's COVID*.

Honestly we need to send teams down there to help them sequence and test so we know what's actually going on. Is this Delta? Is this omicron? Is this a concurrent wave of RSV like we saw in the US with the Delta wave?

There's honestly no good data so far and this article is very poorly representing the actual facts."
12/4/2021 6:42,"If the first omicron case was early November it would be likely there are no deaths yet. Deaths lag cases by at least a couple weeks.

12/4/2021 6:42,"Well, we clearly don't know yet. It may be as severe as Delta or weaker, but not stronger than it, that's for sure.  


Though, it might be just that people are only dying slower."
12/4/2021 6:41,"That's what the paltry amount of information is pointing to.

For what it’s worth, the key for me was not actually rest. No matter how tired I felt I made myself exercise and stay active. More rest makes it worse. There is a certain anxiety which post viral syndrome creates because you never know when symptoms will hit, but the key in those moments is the realization that you’re okay, and that the anxiety of the symptoms is usually worse that the actual symptoms when it comes to post-viral syndromes. Weather the storm and keep going. You’ll be alright."

12/4/2021 5:56,"I’m very sorry and completely understand that problem.  A lot of the masks are simply “minimal” (badly designed and/or poorly fit) and don’t allow for much movement (including talking).

Jokes aside, if this is something that is seriously bothering you, consider some better made masks.  I’d recommend something from Halyard if you’re in the US.  They are a “local” company, with most of the masks made either in the US or Mexico, and the masks tend to have better coverage because they’re made for actual medical use (as opposed to the pandemic secondary market).  They are also available directly on Amazon.

Beyond the basic over the ear masks, their n95 “duckbill” style loop around the head (which is a godsend if you’re wearing it all day), and the duckbill style leaves more room around the mouth so it doesn’t feel as constrained or move around as you talk (though I can’t argue with the fact it looks “silly” to a lot of people)."

The only side effect I had was fatigue after the second dose, so I was surprised at my body's immune response with the 3rd. 10/10 would do again though."

I don’t disagree, I am simply explaining why virtually no country has done what youre suggesting, are you open to the idea that it’s a complicated issue, and that, not having the experience of someone in government or policy, you may not fully understand why these things progress as they do?

They are taking a monumental and brave step forward, and doing exactly what you want, despite other countries refusing to, for no other reason than money. So why are you upset w/ the German gvmnt and not all the other countries who refuse to do the same?

12/4/2021 5:52,"More or less my experience. First one was a sore arm, second one was feeling sick for 24 hours but nothing unmanageable really. Booster was back to the sore arm and some mild body aches.

Considering why we need boosters, this doesn't really surprise me since feeling sick is just your immune system working properly."
12/4/2021 5:52,"I'm in the southern tier and when Delta hit back in Sept/Oct (maybe earlier) it peaked in a couple weeks and just kept right on going. I've mentioned this in other threads but in the counties near me we've had higher peak infections now than back in the winter after the 2020 holidays. And it's still going. I don't think hospitals are quite as bad here as they are further upstate though, so we've got that at least."
12/4/2021 5:52,"Yeah. I don’t know if you come to seattle, but some neighborhoods are 90% masked up…. Outdoors when going to be near others. Doesn’t hurt that it’s very cold!

No it won't be a miracle.

It'll just be T-cells working exactly like everyone expects them to.

12/4/2021 5:49,"Just cause some other virus evolved to be less dangerous does not mean that is the direction that all viruses are going to take. Think of some other viruses out there besides the flu. Did they evolve to be less dangerous? Rabies. Measles. Ebola.

Yes, a virus that swiftly kills someone is not beneficial to spreading, but several weeks of being infected and contagious is good enough to spread with the rate that this spreads. It doesn’t need to become less dangerous to efficiently spread. Someone doesn’t need to infected for months to spread this to many people. It has reproduced already at that point and spread. So what if you are dead a month later?

A virus doesn’t have some evolutionary end goal of becoming less dangerous. It isn’t “seeking” anything. It isn’t something we can simply count on. We need to stop assuming this and suggesting this because it is minimizing the danger this virus possesses. It could evolve into something more dangerous AND more efficient at spreading.

12/4/2021 5:48,"A selection of interesting parts:

> “While people are freaking out, the other thing to stress is that if you look across the variants, the vaccines have protected against severe disease, hospitalization and death. And really, looking at the omicron mutations, though there are an awful lot of them, there’s nothing really to indicate that the ability of vaccines to fight this is going to be affected to a very great extent.”

> “We are seeing breakthrough infections of people who have been vaccinated, but the infections we’re seeing are very mild to moderate. So for health care workers who have had boosters, it’s mostly mild. I think this whole thing has been so poorly communicated and so much panic generated.”

> “Omicron seems to be moving at a faster speed than delta, but at the same time what seems to be happening is that our hospitalization rate is somewhat more muted.”

> “All the data has shown that children have a less severe clinical course and we’ve had some anecdotal reports from hospitals in South Africa, that yes, they are seeing a few more children in some of the hospitals and are admitting them, but many of them have an uncomplicated clinical course during the few days that they are in hospital.”

> “It was like a tap being turned on from Thursday or Friday last week. It’s been mostly young people, but there have been some older people, probably around 20%.”"
12/4/2021 5:47,"Delta still tops? No crap, given Omicron just popped up.

Give me a break with these headlines."
12/4/2021 5:47,It’s an anti-retroviral cocktail. It prevents the virus from replicating.
12/4/2021 5:47,It can take weeks to get sick enough to get hospitalized and even more weeks to die after. We've know this variant existed for like 10 days. Can we let a month of data roll in before we start trying to predict the future? It's like trying to call an election before a single vote has been counted.
12/4/2021 5:47,"So, this is strong evidence that Omicron evolved in a person with HIV, huh."

12/4/2021 5:45,Same with my wife. She had bad symptoms up until about 30 hours after the shot and then started to feel better out of nowhere.
12/4/2021 5:45,Wait for it.
12/4/2021 5:45,"I’m in the same boat as you. I had Moderna. 

Shot # 1, just kind of run down the next day.

Shot #2. Started feeling off about 6 hours after the shot. 12 to 18 hours after I had a 102 degree fever(took Tylenol at that point), headache, chills, and nausea. I spent multiple bouts on the bathroom floor dry heaving. Only reason I didn’t barf was there was nothing on my stomach. My husband had to help me off the hallway floor at one point because I felt too dizzy and sick to stand. Around the 18 hour mark, the really bad symptoms chilled out and from the 18 to 36 hour mark I just felt vaguely nauseous and couldn’t stay awake for more than 2 hours at a time. Day after that, just kind of run down and still not a full appetite.

Basically, I am also afraid to get the booster. Everyone I know has felt the worst from their third shot. I feel like if I get much sicker from it, that I will need to go to the hospital for the shot. I’m very torn, because I am also afraid of CoVid. I’m 39, in good shape, eat healthy, no comorbids, so maybe I should fear the booster more than CoVid for a couple more months? Idk. I definitely plan on eventually getting it, I just feel like I need to maybe wait until 9 months after shot 2."

12/4/2021 5:44,"I got my Moderna booster and flu shot at the same time.  I didn't even feel the Moderna vaccine; they use such a small needle for it.  I felt the flu shot.  I had a slightly sore arm for a day but no other symptoms. I really thought I'd feel bad getting both, but nothing happened."
12/4/2021 5:42,"If your company has any source of government contracts or government funding then it most likely has this stance. I know a few people who are either retiring or hemming and hawing about the vaccine, but they’ll probably end up getting it since they can’t make nearly the same amount of money elsewhere."

12/4/2021 5:40,"Learn may not be the perfect wording for it. More like it mutates in an attempt to get around any possible antibodies. When it comes into contact with someone vaccinated, the antibodies take it down and repel it because they remember the sequence matching the virus. When it finds a host that its able to infect, it reproduces rapidly, and each copy it creates of itself mutates more and more until its unrecognizeable by those same antibodies."

Im SO fucking pissed off at our government and these agencies for delaying things this far. These weeks of delays WILL result in preventable deaths of children. This should have been all hands on deck from the start, run in parallel with ""Operation Warp Speed,"" but as usual we treat our own children as the last priority in this country, and heaven forbid the rest of the adults in this country step up to get vaccinated to protect out kids...."

We're vaxxed and boosted (just, so I guess in the waiting period for that), which is a huge help. But keeping an eye out. I'm right next to Philly, and not at all surprised it's here."
12/4/2021 5:35,"It's kinda weird here. You have to sign the paper that N person has died from Covid. Many people don't sign since it means stuff like you can't really bury the person, transfer the body, etc. At some point government was literally paying you for signing these papers.   


Then at some point I had a feeling like Covid tests during the first wave were like a coin flip. I was actually sitting in a queue for the results and only heard positive-negative-positive-negative and so on; so like half of the queue was positive. I blamed the questionable tests and manual pumping the covid infection rate in a country.   


A lot of people in Russia don't believe in Covid. They think it's just another method to keep the crowd in control and tax money randomly (at first it was really bad; people were fined without getting an illness; and then fined a couple more times while proving that you are not ill). Many were against wearing masks. And seeing how nothing is happening around them only fuels the doubt. Becomes even more complicated cause some political rumors started spreading (like N politic is gathering an army; but everyone should sit at home so nobody would notice; idk).  


But then there are regions that we receive no news from. Situation is kinda bad there. Everyone should sit at home but noone is controlling it. My pregnant sister was supposed to get married but her groom has randomly died from Covid.   


Overall it's kinda... I don't know. The statistic is wrong; the rumors are lies; people don't believe covid exists but someone is dying somewhere; nothing is properly reported; close to you people are getting infected but they don't believe it was covid; TV reports that most of the world is using our vaccine; nobody questions the covid tests. It's weird and digging the truth doesn't look worthwhile."

I hope we get through this but we will see.  Even if one dose it's better than March 2020.  I guess we will see what happens.
12/4/2021 5:24,"Well, my degree is for biomedical engineering haha 

I definitely abused the word some but the concept of ""immune priviledge"" is an official term. Certain areas of your body are ""immune priviledged"", such as your eyes or nervous system. Your immune system won't attack these areas. 

A lot of cells (all? Not sure...) have molecular tags on them that basically let your immune cells recognize that they are not invaders, but are your actual body. I meant to say that the virus's [possible] human RNA it inserted into its own genome isn't going to make the immune system view the virus as a regular part of the body."
12/4/2021 5:24,"So long as someone has access to the current medication, you can basically keep your viral loads undetectable. This also means you cannot transmit the virus to other people.*

Doesn’t seem like it’s exactly LGT, but multiple viruses can invade a single cell. Viral replication is usually inherently messy and sometimes a bit from virus A mixes in with virus B. Might be non-viable 99.9999% of the time, but when you’re doing billions of replications in a single infected human…

The flu is notorious for doing this or a similar mechanism and swapping parts between flus that primarily infect different species, like birds, swine, and humans."

12/4/2021 5:21,Ok act now slow down the spread and then what? Omicron will still be here. This isn’t like 2020 where we were waiting for vaccines. Now there is really no reason to think we will be able to handle this better in the future. Social distancing is a temporary measure only.

12/4/2021 5:19,Uh? Does someone wanna tell em?
12/4/2021 5:19,I saw that on a previous thread about him.   I would have written it off as a cold or something because I always have one this time a year because I don't dress properly.
12/4/2021 5:19,"The week or so before boosters were approved, I called my 85 year old mom and told her she needed to see about getting it. She said she didn't think they were giving it in her area yet (she got Moderna), but she agreed to call about it. Her PA said she didn't need one. I persisted. Luckily, my mom is a retired nurse and despite living in a very red area, she is taking the pandemic seriously. She called again and was one of the first people in the area to get boosted."

Winter is Always going to be the best time for these types of viruses to circulate, so it's best to be best prepared for them ....... By Boosting."
12/4/2021 5:17,Well to attend things in NYC you need to be fully vaccinated.   I guess we will see how the vaccine works under a stress test in a vaccinated population.   This could let us know what kind of winter the vaccinated are in for.   I hope it's not awful.
12/4/2021 5:17,Yes
12/4/2021 5:17,"2 gave me a nasty hangover the next morning but Tylenol cleared it up pretty well.

3 did nothing at all for me.

All were Pfizer."
12/4/2021 5:17,"Not ideal, not surprising either. Look at the number from SA, it's scary fast compared to even delta.

Kinda (still TBD) looks like vaccines are effective still but not past kicks at the can with the live virus. But of course the vaccinated look like the spread it just fine,  very likely at reduce rates though.

This is just going to race through any and all unvaccinated groups by early next year. And with tolerance for restrictions by the very group we are trying to protect at all time low, this will be grim globally. Far more deaths in front of us than behind. That and most poor nations still don't have supply to those that want the freaking shot already. Shame on the west for that one.

I have no idea what the answer is."

>More kids are being admitted than during the early stages of the country entering the current fourth wave of infections, although a similar trend occurred during the third wave when delta was dominant, said Waasila Jassat, public health specialist at the institute. 

So nothing new?

12/4/2021 5:10,Check the subreddit; this is relevant and current news given its within a few days of public attention of this variant in general and i think roughly only day 3 of the first known case in the US
12/4/2021 5:10,"I traveled to NYC the week before the anime con (saw the ads everywhere).  The level of mask wearing is high compared to where I live.  People wear them outside, or have them around their wrists to pop on when heading indoors.  The vaccination rate is high compared to almost anywhere in the USA.  Restaurants and venues need vaccine IDs presented for entry.  Some joints had bouncers.

I never witnessed anyone being a dick about it.  My entire trip felt safe.  I was probably less likely to catch COVID in NYC than grocery shopping in my much less vaccinated city today.

FWIW, I was double vaccinated (though boosted since getting back)."
12/4/2021 5:09,"Everyone reacts differently to the booster. Shot one took me DOWN for a day and half. Shot two, unpleasant but not as bad. Booster: six days of fever, yet very low, Tylenol did its job, and I worked through it, business as usual. I guess the way I look at it is that suffering after each one of the vaccines meant I was having a really good immune response. I know it's definitely not pleasant, but if you try to mentally frame it as a positive thing it's not as bad."
12/4/2021 5:08,"That is simply not true, there was a huge spike in per capita pediatric hospitalizations during the last Delta surge in SA.  In fact, if you look at the per capita hospitalization rate in children under 5, it’s still significantly lower than the peak of the previous Delta surge.

An increase in the raw number of hospitalizations just means more kids are getting infected, but if they are not being hospitalized at a higher rate then it’s just more disease, not more severe disease."
12/4/2021 5:08,He’s reaching.

12/4/2021 5:04,"I don't even get how it's a reading that things are over even ignoring Delta. Isn't there something about a lag on death numbers, since people don't just spontaneously die after getting sick?"
12/4/2021 5:04,"From my understanding, children spiked first in other waves too. Perhaps because men feel too proud to go until there is no other option, but some parents want to rush their child to a doctor or hospital over anything. So even if both are affected equally, there could be a lag for others making it look worse."
12/4/2021 5:04,No. The case in New Jersey is a Georgia resident but she is still in NJ. No cases in Georgia yet.

And we know that dose 2 is undercounted in NYS for several reasons (including students who got shot 1 at college and shot 2 at home). 

Minimally, can you at least give some credit to the people who got at least 1 shot and have at least some level of protection? Jeesh, perfect is the enemy of the good"
12/4/2021 5:00,"No, that can’t explain it or we would have seen similar spikes with previous variants in SA. We don’t see that.

Edit: yes, we did see spikes in pediatric hospitalizations with previous waves. I meant to refer to the fact that pediatric hospitalizations make up a much larger % with omicron compared to previous variants (at least in the limited data we have so far)."
12/4/2021 5:00,"Feels like all the other times when they find a handful of cases, then a cluster, then another cluster... and then you just see it spread and spread and spread and spread. Let's hope this is different. If the existing vaccines (and vaccinations) are enough to blunt severity, even if they don't blunt spread, that will be a miracle."

12/4/2021 4:56,thing is they pretty much do pay taxes and more than in other country...your utility bills all have taxes that are about triple the amount of your bill (keep in mind the services you pay taxes towards dont even exist) you pay taxes on everything in greece even a phone card for example. 12.50 euros ..the credit costs 12 but you only recieve between 9-10 euros and the extra fisty cents is another tax...the idea that greece doesnt pay tax maybe because people earn less than what the taxes are ...what people earn a month here (possibly 12 to 16 hour shifts no days off ) is what someone earns in a day in other countries

Originally Pfizer wanted to submit for EUA for age 2-11 in September but FDA ultimately made the decision to request several extra months of follow-up data on the trial participants under age 5, against the advice of many.

12/4/2021 4:50,It has been available for nearly half a year. They could have made it mandatory months ago when vaccination rates clearly stagnated.
12/4/2021 4:50,"Right, I should have phrased it better. Current Delta prevelance is low."
12/4/2021 4:50,"Just as another anecdote, I got my booster shot on noon Monday, felt like POOP starting on 3-4am on Tues ( it woke me up, fell asleep fine ), and I went to sleep that night feeling alright and woke up completely normal by Wednesday morning."
12/4/2021 4:50,That is probably the most intelligent response I’ve seen on Reddit. Well said.
12/4/2021 4:50,Pfizer 1 was sore arm. Pfizer 2 was nap for 2 days. Pfizer booster was nap one day and muscle aches. Nothing that bad except me being cranky.

12/4/2021 4:50,"Is it possible they are seeing more kids hospitalized because SA has more kids with other health issues? For example, the HIV rate in the population there is quite high and presumably there are more kids born HIV positive. And I'm not writing off the kids with this comment, just to be clear. Every kid matters equally. I'm just wondering if it's a possible cause of higher numbers that we might not need to be as worried about happening in the USA (for example)."
12/4/2021 4:49,I remember reading on the nursing sub a while back about a lady that had to get a vaccine for her job. She put a raw chicken breast under her shirt and refused to expose her upper arm. The nurse wasn't fooled.
12/4/2021 4:49,"Most mutations are single nucleoside changes, additions, or deletions.  Sometimes though we see the addition of multiple bases in the middle of the genome.  These newly inserted sequences have been observed to be similar to sequences in other viruses or the host organism.

One theory is during viral replication, the newly created strand and replication enzyme break away from the parent strand.  A nearby free floating bit of RNA with a similar sequence might take the place of the parent strand and the replication continues.

12/4/2021 4:49,"Why would you mandate something you know most people will take willingly? When there’s an initial lack of supply, too. That is nonsensical. You offer it for free, for those who want it first, and need it most, to build consensus and a majority, THEN you mandate it, so the holdouts are a minority, and so as few people as possible view it as being forced on them.

That is why it was done this way, in multiple countries. It is common sense public policy."

12/4/2021 4:46,"I'll need to hear why these kids are getting admitted and how bad their symptoms are before I can conclude anything. Hospitalisations in and of themselves, especially at the beginning of a frenzy surrounding a new variant, don't say much."

12/4/2021 4:42,"I have a 3 year old and can't even lie. Everyone including the FDA is just like oh but it doesn't cause severe illness in children therefore who cares...well guess what, it was always worse for the age 0-5 group in terms of hospitalizations (and now probably about to get much worse) than for both the age 5-11 or 12-18 groups. But it was oh age 5-11 need to be in school, but age 0-5 are in childcare with fewer kids. Well not by much and they also have zero concept of hygiene - every parent knows that their infants and toddlers bring home more illness from daycare than older kids from school. Furthermore, infants and toddlers make their parents sicker because you can't just isolate them in a room by themselves, you are right there in their faces, with them getting snot in your mouth, getting the highest load of their virus. I have never been sicker from literally everything than since I've had a kid.

We have been sitting ducks for exactly this happening, FDA is scratching their butts trying to make extra extra sure it doesn't cause mild self-resolving and usually asymptomatic heart inflammation caused far more by the virus itself than the vaccine and had required extra followup data, further slowing this age group indefinitely. Come the fuck on already, it's still a damn pandemic emergency and it was only a matter of time until this happened."
12/4/2021 4:41,"I get you're frustration, their reply was snobby but I believe you're thinking right but up the wrong tree. Viruses generally evolve through duplication and spread. Increased harm is not a very common trend for a disease to mutate to because sickly - or dead - symptoms don't help spread as well as a mild symptoms around others. That's a big reason diseases evolve to become colds. It's how the spanish flu went away: it evolved into a cold."

12/4/2021 4:39,We're told to follow the guidance of the CDC. That says 6 months from your second dose. If we give a booster to someone and it hasn't been 6 months it's an incident that we didn't follow guidelines. God forbid the person has a reaction and sues and we didn't follow guidelines and corporate policy. Then the pharmacist is really screwed. I'm not losing my job/license because someone didn't want to wait 2 days. Not when I have hundreds of doses in my fridge and several openings every day.

12/4/2021 4:38,"Has there ever been any more research on how and why people react to shots differently? Curious because I got my Moderna booster shot on Monday and it was completely different from my first 2 (Moderna) shots.

For me, my first 2 shots were almost identical. Arm pain only lasting about 36 hours after the shot, minor swollen lymph nodes in my armpits for 36, and that was about it.   But DAMN my booster kicked my but. I had muscle pain, weird fever dreams, headaches, more than normal swollen feeling in my armpits, and an overall feeling like I had the flu for, again , 36 hours after the shot or so. After that I honestly felt absolutely fine.

Is there a consensus  on if it's better to react strongly, or not?  Just curious as to why my booster experience was so different."
12/4/2021 4:38,Looks like the highest currently is 27-28%. It really is amazing to learn that.
12/4/2021 4:38,Exactly. This is obviously worse. No need to see data from a year ago.

12/4/2021 4:35,"Viruses replicate by having a human (or whatever the host is) cell make all the virus building blocks which then bumper car around in the cell until the matching ends hit each other and stick, after all the pieces stick together you have a new virus.

If a person is infected with two different viruses at the same time, then the host cell ends up with the building blocks from both viruses bumper carring around. Sometimes a new piece gets stuck to one of the assembling viruses, this new piece is an insert from the other virus.

Similarly, human cells have all kinds of human RNA in them. Sometimes a piece of human RNA gets stuck in an assembling virus, this would be a human insert."

12/5/2021 14:42,Being irrational became something good and to be praise. Specially in  the last 30 years.
12/5/2021 14:41,Covid.
12/5/2021 14:41,Do you think it's going to take another weekend and a half to find out like everybody is saying?
12/5/2021 14:40,"We have no idea how the overall balance of factors will play out yet. To conclude it would be an “unquestionably worse” situation is ridiculous. 

There exists a scenario where omicron is more contagious and simply not burdensome to the hospital system due to vaccine efficacy, protection from prior infection. Yes, it seems like prior infection won’t stop you from getting re-infected, but it might be reflected as more attenuated symptoms. We just don’t know yet. 

More infections + less susceptible to vaccines is only part of the equation. You don’t yet know what/how symptoms of omicron present themselves relative to Delta or prior variants."
12/5/2021 14:40,"I argue for why the construction of the study in question is flawed. So far, the only counter you have presented to those arguments is an ad hominem of ""random redditor"". If you care about the truth, address the arguments, they're based on observable facts.

As mentioned, given the demographics of the wave and the recency of it, we would expect the statistics presented in the study even if the variant was in fact significantly more virulent than Delta. Thus the statistics have no power to indicate whether Omicron is more or less virulent than Delta.

The analysis from SA leaked by Channel 12 in Israel is what I originally referred to, and that one indicates worse outcomes across all types of immunity for Omicron compared to Delta.

Furthermore, ICU admissions in the Gauteng province is now above 100, rising rapidly. More data available from the source below.

There's tons of stuff that is as misinformed or sensational as anything you'd find on Facebook, especially anything even remotely regarding politics. And it's greeting you as soon as you open Reddit up and are presented with the most popular posts.

There is no good social media. Reddit might be on the right side of Covid though...to a degree, however they also like to think all the unvaccinated people are Conservative thus making something political when it most certainly shouldn't be. They also tend to lean towards the idea that only unvaccinated people are spreading Covid and vaccinated people don't have to take any precautions anymore, and that is dangerous misinformation . There's potential cases of Omicron around NYC right now centered around a anime convention where you had to show a vaccination card to attend. Lots of vaccinated people crammed into one convention center and the virus is still being spread.

Sorry for the long winded post but I just read that NY Times article and it irritates me how so many people think this pandemic is over."

12/5/2021 14:31,"No.  Standard PCR testing won’t show the type/variant.

However, omicron does have a tendency to show up because it often drops out at one of the test sites they look for (usually three, but depends on your country, could be looking at just two).   So a 2/3 or 1/2 positive match is likely omicron (though it can just happen with a bad sample, or low viral load)."

12/5/2021 14:19,"1% isn't a rate! It's a percentage of people. 1% per month? Per year? Per lifetime? You're acting like this snapshot in time is some sort of natural law. The real math is governed by how many of those prior-infected were re-exposed, which probably isn't more than 20% of them, and how much the effect decays with time. 

If in a study period 5% of naive patients get covid and 1% of prior infected patients get it, that doesn't mean that prior infected have a 1% chance of getting covid going forward. It means they have _at least_ a 20% chance of getting it. That's how vaccine efficacy is calculated.

All that aside, it's simply not mathematically likely for a virus today to have a Rt of 3 or 3.5 (as is being reported for omicron in SA) unless it's infecting a lot of the vaccinated or prior infected."

12/5/2021 13:59,"Studies of the protection afforded by previous infection have generally found somewhere in the 90% effectiveness range against reinfection (or alternatively ~10% “breakthrough” rate, give or take). Whether that would hold up forever is another story. Some estimates are a bit higher, some a bit lower, but around that. So, 3x that would put it around ~70%.

Here’s an Eric Topol chart based on this study we’re commenting on that illustrates it (his has it at about 75% protection but obviously still early in the game and I figured ~70% would be a little more conservative to assume): https://twitter.com/EricTopol/status/1466878267344883718

Could it end up being 60 or 50 or 80% Sure. But the point is that “three times more reinfections!” sounds petty bad, and I’m not saying it’s great, but if it holds up more or less in that way then it isn’t the catastrophic outcome that some seem to be painting it as (at least when it comes to just reinfection rate.

It could have been circulating globally for months before the first known cluster was identified.

Omicron is the same deal. It could have been making the rounds slowly evolving in many regions where they're not actively looking for variats for months. It only came to light when there were a critical mass of cases being identified near a specialized virology lab.

12/5/2021 13:47,"No. 

Or yes, but there’s no real reason it should head in that direction.

All viruses randomly mutate. Almost all of those mutations mean the virus doesn’t work any more, so those strains die out.

Some strains mean it spreads more effectively, those ones will spread and become dominant. 

In some circumstances more mild viruses spread more easily. If Covid killed you 30 minutes after you were exposed then you wouldn’t have much time to infect anyone else and a variant that was less lethal would have an advantage and take over. 

Covid isn’t that lethal (luckily). It takes weeks to produce serious illness. It has a long period at the start when you can be contagious but pre-symptomatic or even stay asymptomatic and be contagious the whole time. It’s a very well evolved virus in that respect, and changing the number of people who die from 0.4% to 0.2% isn’t going to make much difference to the fitness of the virus. 

On the other hand the things that would have to change to make the virus less lethal could easily reduce the amount of transmission. Say for example it mutates to reproduce less aggressively in the lungs, therefore doing less damage and killing less people. That would probably also reduce the number of virus particles that you breath out, reducing the chance of you infecting someone else. That’s not a variant that’s going to spread. 

The evolutionary pressure on Covid is around transmissibility, and now particularly immune escape. If there’s a mutation that makes it easier for Covid to spread through a vaccinated/exposed population (as it seems there is in Omicron) then that’s the one that’s going to become dominant, regardless of whether it causes more or less severe disease."
12/5/2021 13:47,You have a link?
12/5/2021 13:46,"In addition to what everyone else said… mention that the basis of comparison is not “Vaccine vs. No Vaccine.” 

It’s “Vaccine vs. Covid,” since without vaccination your chances of catching Covid are extremely high. 

Let’s use the side effect of myocarditis as an example. Yes, some people have experienced that after the Covid vaccines. A much higher percentage of people experience myocarditis after Covid. You are much likely to have myocarditis after being sick than you are after being vaccinated. 

Ask her why she is scared of one but not the much more likely other. It’s intellectually dishonest to avoid one and court the option that is actually more dangerous. 

This is true for basically every single Covid vaccine side effect."
12/5/2021 13:44,"This is true, but I also think that a lot of countries will move towards population-wide vaccine mandates now that Austria has broken the taboo on that. We've seen that the unvaccinated disproportionately make up cases and hospitalisations, so once more countries move in that direction, things will be better I feel. Plus, antivirals are still in very early stages of deployment right now. So it's not just down from here, things can and should improve."

The next day we had a get together with some friends (all of us were fully vaxxed, aside from the kids and only because it wasn’t yet approved for them). Two days later, my friends son was tested again and tested positive. 

Many of us tested after hearing that news. No one tested positive except that one boy. 

Even in quarantine, the family still had multiple tests, no one else ever tested positive, including his unvaccinated 3 year old brother.

Having 80+% of the population vaccinated AND basic NPIs in place didn't stop countries like Belgium, Singapore or Ireland from having to impose additional strong restrictions to cope with the current Delta wave. Omicron would just be worse.

When news of the Omicron variant emerged, countries were quick to shut borders, and global financial markets were rattled. Now as the panic subsides, some scientists are saying the new variant doesn’t look so bad.

Vaccines seem to be effective against the new variant, GlaxoSmithKline and the World Health Organization found, and scientists around the world reiterated that there is no evidence the Omicron variant is more deadly than previous strains.

“Currently, there is no reason for panicking, as we don’t see severely ill patients,” Dr. Angelique Coetzee, chair of the South African Medical Association, told the Telegraph."
12/5/2021 13:34,"When those brave souls made their sacrifices, they were fighting an enemy who literally piled up bodies in the name of their own freedoms. They fought to bring an end to the horrors of war and to restore peace to the world. If my grandfather was alive today, I know for certain that he would want to protect the weak and the vulnerable from the ravishes of this disease. I can also tell you that I value my freedoms, and those of everyone else. If those freedoms nee to be temporarily compromised in order to win this fight against COVID-19, then so be it.  I don't see the need for those compromises to be permanent and expect those freedoms to be fully restored when this is done and dusted. If they are not, then the restoration of those freedoms will be a cause worth fighting for, but not yet, not now. Furthermore, I would not fight for the freedoms of those who were prepared to sacrifice the lives of others to further their own ends, but against them."
12/5/2021 13:33,It's not.
12/5/2021 13:33,That’s about the size of it
12/5/2021 13:32,"I personally feel safe too, but its not just about me. It's about the impact on the population as a whole, because if hospitals fill up that will affect me whether I catch Covid or not."
12/5/2021 13:31,It's a wee bit difficult to predict when a virus will mutate to become mild enough to not require any restrictions.
12/5/2021 13:31,"Higher rates of reinfection probably means lower protection of vaccines against infection, which is pretty important"
12/5/2021 13:31,"Havnt I been reading since the start of this that Covid can’t do this, what’s changed"
12/5/2021 13:31,Can someone help with understanding what we know as of today about the new variant? I understand that the research is ongoing but I see a lot of tidbits on the internet. But its a little overwhelming and very technical. can someone give the layperson version of it to me?
12/5/2021 13:31,Lol time to rebrand then
12/5/2021 13:30,"I know pay is bad in pediatrics, but is it really that bad? It's hard to understand why anyone would pick it then. I'm also very suspicious about attendings working 60 hour weeks. I'm not a pediatrician but I barely know any attendings working 40 hour weeks."
12/5/2021 13:30,"If the hospitalisation/death rate is the same, but the transmissibility is higher, then daily hospital admissions and daily deaths will rise.

Both transmissibility and severity are real questions."
12/5/2021 13:29,"Possibly hits children more

not sure there is any substantial evidence for this but rest I agree with"
12/5/2021 13:29,There's nothing to indicate it's more harmful for vaccinated than other variants.
12/5/2021 13:28,I saw in another article that it is more dangerous for children under 5.
12/5/2021 13:28,Different viruses are different.
12/5/2021 13:28,Add three doses of vaccine to the 12 weeks judge!
12/5/2021 13:27,"I did, and it definitely helped a bit with my headache, but it didn't do much for my general body pain and chills."
12/5/2021 13:26,"The rules are different between countries, states and regions. You should ask on a local sub."
12/5/2021 13:25,Did you try paracetamol?
12/5/2021 13:25,">Wtf are you talking about? That is LITERALLY what happened with Spanish flu and H1N1.

While H1N1 certainly was a very transmissable and deadly strain, it got weaker after the 1918 pandemic. But that's not because it adapted to it's new host. Since 50 million people died during the pandemic, the virus already had a high transmission rate despite being also very deadly.

The reason the virus got weaker is because the human immune system adapted to it. Once enough people were infected once, the immune system could act faster at a second infection and lower the transmission rate as well as the symptoms. 

The idea that a higher transmission rate goes along with a decrease in mortality is sometimes true, but often wrong.

Rabies for example doesn't trade it's mortality for a higher transmission rate. Just like smallpox, Ebola, Marburg Virus, HIV, Hepatitis and other virus diseases. 

There is currently no evidence that SARS-COV-2 will evolve to be less deadly. There is evidence that vaccination or a previous infection lowers the chance of dying from the virus and makes the course of disease less severe. That is most likely what will happen in the next few years. Not mutations."

12/5/2021 13:16,"I'm now realising you likely didn't read the article in question.

How would you know people around you had brain bleeds etc.?"
12/5/2021 13:16,"I feel like as more time is passing and the hype is dying down a little bit, the truth seems to be somewhere in between 'this is a harmless cold-like variant' and 'this is literally the end of the world as we know it.' 

Bad:

* Obviously spreads faster

* Possibly hits children more

* Vaccines do not protect against infection as much

* Higher risk of reinfection

Good:

* Vaccines still work against severe disease 

* POSSIBLY a slightly less deadly variant, judging by anecdotal reports and somewhat slower hospitalisations, though this is still hard to gauge

* Antivirals will be very effective still

So we can conclude that it's not an ideal outcome, but it's still manageable. We're incredibly lucky that most of the mutations weren't in the regions that had to do with T cell evasion."
12/5/2021 13:16,"I agree, my real point is when discussing effectiveness and dude effects and then translating them to layman's terms I don't think much stronger should be used when they are both highly effective."

12/5/2021 13:15,"Universal travel bans + entry testing and quarantines work. Examples are Australia and New Zealand. Country specific travel bans, like the one being suggested above, e.g., ban travel from China at the beginning of the pandemic, are ineffective."
12/5/2021 13:14,"Yeah it has been better. But if over 1000 vaccines are given and in comparison with Delta moderna prevents 3 infections I wouldn't say it is ""much stronger"" I would say it is more efficacious with a higher dose.

And I did research with moderna, I prefer it, but I just don't think belittling another very good vaccine makes sense."
12/5/2021 13:13,"Well, cynically, if local US police departments could add 'being unvaccinated' to the list of things that they could ticket for, we'd see much higher vaccination rates, particularly among POC and immigrant communities. (It's one of the ways that police departments pad their massive budgets - giving out tons of tickets for minor violations)."

12/5/2021 13:08,"Okay so, I was going off memories of news about Vietnam's success between 2020 to mid 2021 and somehow hadn't heard that they were on a big outbreak now. For a country on land, with a border with China, and a population of almost 100 million, they still held the line long enough that it's credible that a successful defense against Covid can be mounted on land. 

China, with a 1.4 billion population, has to try for low/zero Covid because if they went any lighter they would have a potential India situation on their hands. Even a small percent of 1.4B people dying is an obscenely large number. Their authoritarian measures definitely wouldn't fly with 99% of westerners, but we're only talking about success on land here."

12/5/2021 12:56,"My point was just that we aren't ""basically masking up to protect those who never cared or took any precautions in the first place"". We are masking up to protect those who can't get vaxxed, those for whom the vaccinations don't help much, and those who have decreasing immunity because they can't get boosters yet, and ourselves.

I am not disagreeing with your other statements. Just saying that it's not only because of the anti vaxers."

Also it's unknown if vaccines still prevent severe infection a month or so after an omicron variant infection.  And wearing a mask when around others is helpful even if you are fully vaccinated. The omicron variant maybe has an [R0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number) of about 12-18. It may spread more easily than measles.

It differs from country to country depending on overall health and the quality of health care.  And we don’t know the numbers for the new variant yet as it hasn’t been known long enough. We’ll know more in a couple weeks. Before that it would be better to remain cautious. Delta is reason enough not to take any unnecessary risks…

12/5/2021 12:05,"I presume they are referring to fatalities as a result of taking the vaccine?

As far as I know, it is undeniable that some people have died as the result of adverse effects to the vaccine. That is a fact.

Overall though, these figures are staggeringly low in comparison to how many people have been vaccinated with no ill effects at all. A casual look at that seems to suggest there were 42,000 cases out of multiple countries, which is likely out 100s of millions of people. Seems to me it is way less likely than adverse effects due to c19.

Avoid traveling and others who travel if you can. It's amazing how quickly the omicron variant spreads from country to country, and city to city. It will probably be nearly everywhere in the USA in about two weeks. Unfortunately when hospitals are overwhelmed nearly everywhere, the lock downs and school closures don't do much good because it's too late to keep it out of your community."
12/5/2021 12:02,I assume when you say common cold you're just referring to rhinovirus.
12/5/2021 12:01,"Not an expert: 

That appears to be a post marketing study of adverse effects of the vaccine. It indicates that of all the doses given at the time of data collection, there were over 42,000 reported adverse effects. 175 of these were in children under 17. 

Other things to note: only roughly 29,000 of the adverse effects were confirmed, the others were simply reported. The list of adverse effects seems to include just about everything you can think of including headache, chills, fatigue, or pain at the injection site. 

So basically out of all of the vaccine doses given to children, there have been 175 reports of adverse effects and page 7 doesn't seem to indicate how many of those were confirmed or how many were serious vs. standard vaccine complications. I'd need to spend a lot more time looking through the document but that's my impression from the page you posted. 

That seems to indicate it's a relatively very good safety profile, considering the large number of doses that resulted in those reports. 

Hopefully somebody with a little more of an idea what they're talking about can come along and help you though.

Edit: In the age group under 12 years old, there were 34 cases reported which comprised 0.1% of the test group. 24 of these were reported as serious and 10 as non-serious. It seems to indicate that the largest numbers of incidents reported by far had to do with improper administration or ""off label use"" rather than adverse events. This section concludes by stating that there is no additional safety data implicated by these results compared to the rate of incidents in the general population."
12/5/2021 11:59,">Vietnam and China both succeeded against Covid without being islands

Vietnam is on their second large wave, today their average lately is 14,000 new infections and hundreds of deaths a day, by what measure is that succeeding?

In terms of China, the authoritarian measures they take to maintain a low level of covid is too heavy handed in my opinion as it impacts large amounts of their population despite a small portion actually being at risk."
12/5/2021 11:58,"They are just not sensitive enough so they will miss many cases.
I did some reading on that topic.

The antigen tests detect some protein that is created when the immune System fights the virus.
This protein is produced less in vaccinated persons.

Another issue is the viral load thats generaly lower with the vaccinated. 
And that they have a ""high"" load for a shorter amount of time.
If you catch the vaccinated in that high load phase they seem to work, but before and afterwards they are useless.

They seem to  help  somewhat if you test right before the event.
If you do that half a day or a day before there is enough time to develop a high viral load.

Like always with covid, it's damn complicaited."

12/5/2021 11:50,"You probably know it, i want to say it anyways: Other vaccines are important aswell and all close contacts should check their vaccination e.g. influenza.

RKI also recommends the following:

People with severe ID can receive the third dose as close as 4 weeks after the 2nd. The decision to give another shot (4th) after 6 months has to be decided individually

[2. Dezember 2021]
> Serological tests for specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 should only be carried out 4 weeks after the 2nd vaccine dose AND 4 weeks after the 3rd vaccine dose at the earliest in the case of severely immunodeficient persons with an expected greatly reduced vaccination response (see Table 4) Spike protein (total protein, S1 subunit or receptor binding domain). The blood sample for the first antibody measurement can be carried out on the same date as the third dose of vaccine is administered; in this case, the antibody result for the administration of the 3rd vaccine dose is not awaited. If the antibody response is initially absent or low, a double or multiple measurement enables the observation of a possible vaccination success (antibody dynamics). If, after the third vaccine dose, very low or no specific antibodies are still measurable, the affected patients must be informed about the possible lack of immune protection. [End of page 9] https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2021/Ausgaben/48_21.pdf?__blob=publicationFile

They also recommend using masks for close contacts when in contact with people with ID.

[30. September 2021]
> In the event of a very low or no immune response after the 3rd vaccine dose, the patient must be informed about the possible lack of vaccination protection. Missing 31 Epidemiological Bulletin 39 | 2021 September 30th, 2021 of the immune response after 3 vaccine doses, there are currently no vaccination regimens on how to proceed, based on study data. It is possible to attempt to increase the dose of the mRNA vaccine (e.g. application of a double dose of Comirnaty as an off-label application; or vaccination with Spikevax, which contains an approximately three times higher amount of mRNA than Comirnaty). A vaccine with a different technology can also be used (e.g. vector vaccine or future adjuvanted peptide vaccine). Immunogenicity and efficacy data on such a procedure in immunodeficient patients are not yet available. It should also be borne in mind that in the Com-COV study with immunocompetent patients when comparing the homologous mRNA vaccination scheme (Comirnaty / Comirnaty) with the heterologous mRNA / vector vaccination scheme only for the order Vaxzevria / Comirnaty, but not for the Sequence Comirnaty / Vaxzevria an equally good efficacy has been demonstrated.144 Ultimately, it is also conceivable that patients with severe ID without sufficient active vaccination protection after exposure to SARS-CoV-2 can be protected by passive immunization with monoclonal antibodies. To date, however, insufficient data are available to allow a specific recommendation to be made. 145

12/5/2021 11:36,"Because fear is the basis of control. Keep the population fearful, keep them easy to control. It's so very obvious what is happening around the world and especially in my country of England. The disconnect between the MSM/Labour and the current in power Tory government is incredible.

On one hand we have the Conservatives being incredible truthful about this new variant. It's mild, it's not going to effect the vast majority of people in any significant way, so mask up in shops and public transport, but otherwise continue as normal.

However the Labour Party and MSM are branding this variant as a killer, and using it to spread fear amongst the watchers and voters, branding the Tory government as uncaring monsters. My evidence for this is a Sky News interview in which a Conservative minister is giving advice on the new variant, which is what I described above, yet the interviewer says something along the lines of ""you say, christmas parties can continue, however, The BBC, University of London Student Union and a London based NHS trust, are cancelling their parties, saying they will not take the risk"" this is an obvious ploy to brand the Tory government as not caring about the people. However, these are all left leaning institutions, quite heavily in some cases, and it's clear to me that it's nothing but political.

Ruling conservatives say don't panic, Labour and other left institutions say panic, even though the statistics do not support the need to do so.

That is why I'm not terrified. That and everyone I know who has contracted the ""virus"" throughout the entirety of the ""pandemic"" has developed mild symptoms at worse. I even spent 10 days living with a pal of mine who had tested positive on both kinds of tests, and was required to self isolated. We watched movies and played games in the same room plenty of times, sitting next to each other, maskless, heck, we even shared multiple cigarettes over the course of his isolation. I tested myself daily, and would you know, never once tested positive.

This is why I'm not scared."
12/5/2021 11:36,You need to differentiate between vaccine efficacy against infection and vaccine efficacy against severe disease and hospitalization.  The latter is very unlikely to be that affected and that's the important one.

In light of Omicron variant - do you think opening offices should be delayed further?"
12/5/2021 11:25,"which is why it's problematic. faster replication means that it can get the most out of a host regardless of outcome but also allows for the virus to increase the probability of more errors in replication leading to mutations with each host (and millions of cells it infects). 

Omicron isn't what scares me - it's what can come up after it using its scaffolding that gives me cause for concern."
12/5/2021 11:25,"I advise to call a doc, ask for a pcr test, those are much more reliable as an antigen test. You may wanna call your local health authorities aswell."
12/5/2021 11:25,Hospitalizations/deaths is definitely important but transmissibility is also critical because if the rate of cases increases by a lot more due to higher transmissibility then it can also have a large impact to hospitals - Eg lower % hospitalizations/deaths of a much higher number of cases can be the same outcome as a higher % hospitalizations/deaths of a much lower number of cases.

Can the healthcare system even do anything or does it essentially just let it run it’s course? I figured the oxygen and vents/ecmo and maybe a technique or two here and there maybeeee adds a day or two of the body living to keep trying to beat the virus back. And I’d guess some care would be to prevent or reduce any of the after effects of COVID from killing the patient should they survive its initial infection. 

Stuff like blood clots and lung damage, and the remedies being thinners, other stuff I don’t know of, and lung transplants etc.

2. People who have left healthcare due to the prolonged stress that dealing with Covid patients has brought
3. People who have left for better jobs in healthcare, primarily traveling jobs, due to #1 and 2
4. Getting Covid is minimum 10 days off work, so imagine having an entire unit or department shut down because this spread so easily through the staff

People didn't want to sacrifice the economy because of Covid, so I guess we're gonna sacrifice the healthcare system instead.  I hope everyone stays safe and healthy this winter, the standard wait time in my ER now is greater than 12hrs.

If that is the case then Omicron just might be part of an evolution scientists are hoping for, which is that the the virus is mutating to be less deadly in order to be more transmissible. But that would be the absolute miracle. What's more likely is that Omicron is still going cause a fair amount of deaths and we are just too early to have reported deaths or people have already died and their deaths are in the processing phase before being reported.



All in all even if Omicron turns out to be much less deadly than Delta or the original strain, Delta is still running loose just about everywhere. If Omicron seems to be becoming the dominant strain it would still take Delta months to eventually die out and the precautionary tools of vaccines, masks and distancing are the same for both."

I'm vaccinated myself and still wear a mask everywhere I go since I go since I'm high risk, BUT this tells me that Omicron just might start running rampant in my anti-vaxx, anti-mask area shortly."
12/5/2021 10:37,You start being contagious 2 days before you show symptoms or test positive if you’re asymptomatic. General rule is 14 days in quarantine since contact if you can
12/5/2021 10:36,"You are correct, but building hospitals and training doctors is expensive and takes effort. It is active cost. Telling people to stay home, and doing the bare minimum also has associated costs, in terms of damage to economy etc, but it is a passive cost.

Look at Western Australia, where the medical infrastructure has been collapsing for a long time pre-pandemic. Where ambulances sometimes had to queue up to get into hospitals and wait outside with their patients because there simply wasn't enough medical resources to go around. This naturally, increased ambulance response times, because ambos were stuck dropping off patients! 

When covid hit, naturally, we would expect the drain on medical resources to increase. What did WA do? Improve medical infrastructure? More hospitals, more medical students? No, the cheap and easy, passive cost way of lockdowns. Mark Mcgowan will talk about how only opening up WA's borders only when WA is 90% vaccinated will prevent 200 covid related deaths, but refuses to spend a cent on improving medical infrastructure in the state."
12/5/2021 10:35,Well that makes Iowa's 3rd neighbor with a confirmed case. The other two being Nebraska and Missouri. There's no way in hell Iowa doesn't have cases circulating around and surely it's at least gotten to the Twin Cities and Chicago by now.

12/5/2021 10:08,"Foreigner living in Bulgaria. It's quite common. I went to buy a bike after the green pass was mandatory (though the shop was small enough that it wasn't required in this case) and the shop owner and employee were talking about it. I said I'd been vaccinated, it's no big deal, showed my green pass, said it's been quite easy at the places that check it (which is about 50% of those places that actually should, the other half kind of wink and wave you in without looking).

The owner was like ""Wait you've been vaccinated? Why!? It's a worldwide conspiracy!"" Told her my health was important and didn't want to risk getting the virus and giving it to someone else and killing them. She said that in 10 years I'll regret it. Asked her what will happen in 10 years. She couldn't say. Asked if I'll grow a horn or something and she said ""no no, but you'll see.""

The view that it's a hoax or that the vaccines are dangerous is really prevalent. It's not universal, certainly, but it seems that most of the people I meet out and about feel this way. I can't say all doctors are against it though, I know several who are absolutely encouraging it. The doctor who vaccinated us gave us her cell phone and told us to have anyone who wants the vaccine call her and she'll get them in without them having to use the online booking tool. So it isn't universal, at least."

12/5/2021 9:43,Wait the common cold is a corona virus? Goddamn I’m dumb
12/5/2021 9:43,"I'm from Germany.

Hospitals in the US have been overwhelmed at various times in the pandemic, for example in parts of Texas and Florida during the Delta wave.

About 90% of people who get hospitalized are unvaccinated. The vaccination rate in the US is at 59%, so just over 40% of people are unvaccinated. That's more than a third, so like 130 million people. Delta spreads a lot faster than previous variants, so more people get infected at the same time. It's the ""at the same time"" part that is important. 

Let's say there's a fictional country with 10k inhabitants and 50 hospital beds, and there's a disease that puts 20% of people who get it in the hospital. If only 100 people get infected at once (meaning within a few weeks of each other, because it takes hospitalized patients a few weeks to either get better or die, depending on the situation), only 20 of these 50 beds will be occupied (assuming there are no other diseases that people have to be hospitalized for, which is not the case in real life, so we can't use all of our hospital beds for Covid patients). 

If, instead, 1000 people get infected at once, that's 200 people who need to be hospitalized, or 4 times as many as there are hospital beds, so 3/4 of them would probably just die. 

It's not that bad in real life, this example is just to show you how the math is done, but it's bad enough for there to be some forms of triage going on (for example people's surgeries being put off because they need these people's hospital beds, including surgeries for things like cancer, which you can't really put off if you don't want the cancer to get worse), and often, people need to be distributed to different hospitals because the one they arrived at is already full."
12/5/2021 9:43,The vaccines also decrease the chances of transmission of all previous variants significantly. I don’t think anyone ever promissed the chance would be zero though.
12/5/2021 9:42,I'll take my chances
12/5/2021 9:42,Aghhhrrrrr likely infected
12/5/2021 9:42,"I mean, I would love to say yes. But we don't live in a just world. It's the disabled people I nurse who have to fear for their lives the most."
12/5/2021 9:42,"It's very ironic seeing all the teachers wanting to do IEP meetings over Zoom and my husband's company continuing to push out their ""return to the office"" date due to safety concerns while we send the kids to school everyday.

Especially in light of the fact that all the teachers I know and everyone my husband works with directly are all fully vaccinated and boosted at this point but only our 7 year old is vaccinated (and we got him in literally the first chance we could after the 5+ approval. His second jab was recent enough that he's still not considered fully vaccinated yet), and he has less than 2 full weeks of school left until winter break. The 4 year old keeps asking if she'll be able to get her shot soon or if she'll have to wait for her birthday in early Feb and our only answer is ""I dunno, hopefully you can have yours soon.""

I really feel like they should have approved the vaccines sooner or held onto more remote options until it was approved, but we're a very much ""guns up, let's do this"" country so here we are.

I'm so glad we've been able to avoid any outbreaks so far but it really feels like a race against time with Omicron. I'd hate to get this far only to have our youngest catch it weeks before vaccine approval for her age cohort."

Her 7 year old brother got his second shot right after Thanksgiving and boy is the 4 year old jealous. It seems like since the 5+ cohort got approved it's been radio silence about the younger kids, which has been frustrating after all the talk of ""under 5s likely soon to follow!""

We even hit 5000 cases a day (once) and our population is nearly 10-fold lower than South Korea's! Then the elderly got their boosters and the cases went down, and we're at 28% of the total population boosted now.

South Korean elderly started getting vaccinated in May/Jun, so 6 months later at Nov/Dec they have the same issue. The boosters are the way out."

That virus got after time even deadlier, but only because it was transmitted by flies, which got infected by touching the dead bodies. So more dead rabbits, more transmissions. The virus variant with a higher mortality rate won in this scenario. 

With Corona, there is no reason that a deadlier variant spreads slower and so would lose in the long run, since the time between transmission and the host dying or even shows symptoms is so long that it already could find more hosts."
12/5/2021 9:29,">	Viruses will often mutate into a less deadly form because that provides the most opportunity for successful replication. If you’re less deadly, you have more hosts and your hosts don’t aggressively attempt to avoid you.

If they each infect two people each day you will have 1 093 000 infected after one week. (1 + 1 * 3^(1) + 1 * 3^(2) ... 1 * 3^(6))

It doesn't change the fact that there's a considerable risk for long-term damage (including in kids), at far higher rates than any possible serious side effects from the shot. And it also doesn't change the fact that hospitals are overwhelmed in many regions (including my entire (first world) country), because tons and tons of people, most of whom are unvaccinated, need to go there with Covid.

There was some prediction ac to some expert I remember very well. He said India will face huge amounts of cases due to summer season. Summer begins in India roughly around March first week, ie you start to feel the heat.

What is wrong with attracting trained professionals that are willing to follow science and be at the forefront due to the nature of their work and be vaccinated since they are working directly with people that could be showing up at their hospitals with it? Who is more trustworthy and reliable to you? A chef that washes his/her hands every time they use the restroom?

You’re talking about hospital systems that make nurses take covid sick days out of PTO; that make nurses sign disclaimers essentially saying the hospital is never culpable for contracted illnesses; that throw pizza parties instead of giving raises that have been on hold for years; that have done everything possible to avoid hiring staff nurses at sufficient levels. Nurses are getting fucked over in a very material way relative to the stress, risk and sheer fucking liability dealing with the fallout of this pandemic, despite whatever cursory search you might have made may indicate.

If you combine that with someone like my kid wearing a KF94 mask, it makes things much safer for my kid.

12/5/2021 8:38,"Oh I completely agree that Facebook is toxic trash don’t get me wrong. I deactivated my account long ago. 

But I just think that a lot of the “rush to the extremes” is driven by much more than just social media. It’s the overwhelming amount of choice. Everyone and their aunt can start a blog or news source. I remember before Facebook, there were like 10 ways you could get your news: a couple local papers, a national paper, the 3 or 4 local news networks, and maybe some radio channels. Now it’s like every website ever. 

This unlimited choice leads the publishers to need to latch to something catchy to grab headlines. So while I definitely think Facebook is a cause, I don’t think it alone is the reason. 

I have a similar view on Amazon too fwiw. Amazon too is trash. But before Amazon, your options to buy a mousepad for example were fairly limited. You go to a store and get the options they have. Now you have literal endless choices of where you can buy any product from through Amazon.

12/5/2021 8:28,This is why I think we can't ignore vaccines and rely on just treating the disease alone. Some people are too stubborn to get treatment until it's way too late. They don't know how bad they really are and keep hoping the next day they will wake up feeling better like any other virus they may have had before. Once they finally get to the hospital they're too far gone and any treatment that may have helped them earlier will no longer make a difference.

People HAVE to have their sports. Their bars. Their concerts. Their going out and be close to each other. 
I have zero problems with this. I am a gamer. I can be home and alone 100% of the time. Lock down was amazing. Working from home. Gaming all day. I loved it. 

But the US needs money to make money. People don’t care. They have become numb to the news of “X dead’s today” they don’t care. They care when the next Lakers game is on. Etc. 

My friend in Australia just came out of lockdown cuz they had 2 cases! TWO!!! 

We have thousands in LA county alone but no, we have to be open cuz money. And I get it. Trust me I do. People need to work etc. 

This is why the dang government needs to step in and help those that can’t work due to shut downs. Make it a law or a punishment about the vaccine. 

Look at Germany. Everybody above 60 and not vaccinated will face penalties. 

People can say whatever they want. But other small countries/regions are doing better. Are acting better. 

We in the US don’t care. Cuz guess what? Nobody around us is dying. Cuz “I got COVID and it was just a cold” cuz the news are exaggerating for ratings. 

But don’t they see tons of post here and on the news. Tons of non believers changing their minds after a love one dies!? Come on man. 

Fuck, how the hell did the human race survive Polio!? 

This are some scary and sad times. Kids dying at school thanks to the second amendment and politician having a stake when it comes to profiting from gun selling not doing nothing at all. 
Tons of robberies all over on plain daylight. 
Killers getting away. COVID infecting thousand per day and all of them playing Russian roulette to see if they make it at night with mild symptoms or severe. 

We might not be able to do and help everybody. But come on. Do the bare minimum. 
Do you really have to go to the bar and watch the game? Do you really have to be inside of a store and not cover your mouth?

12/5/2021 8:09,"I've looked for recent general population studies of seropositivity across the globe and I'm still trying since the latest information I could find with a brief search was from last March when the global seropositivity was estimated at about 3%. It has, of course, increased since then. More recently (November 5, 2021 publication date) a specific study looked at seropositivity amongst health care workers in Colombia. The prevalence there was 35% . See [Seroprevalence of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody in healthcare workers: a multicentre cross-sectional study in 10 Colombian cities](https://oem.bmj.com/content/early/2021/11/05/oemed-2021-107487) . This was a study of the most exposed population possible in a country with a severe problem. In Ireland last year (June - July 2020) a [general population study](https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2021.26.48.2001741) found rates of 5% - 12%. In contrast to this a study in India in January 2021 [found a seropositivity rate of 50% to 60%](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772707621000229). 

The trouble with seropositivity rates is that they are a moving target in both time and space. They will vary tremendously between countries because of both vaccination and because of natural infection. Then there's time. The vast majority of people seroconvert with both vaccination and covid infection, but the antibody levels decline with time as we are finding out. As newly vaccinated or recovered patients come on the conveyer belt from one direction people with waning immunity fall off it further down the line."

12/5/2021 8:08,I honestly do not care about reinfection.  I want to know about virulence.  I understand that reinfection is an important stat but that is to functionally think that we will ever be covid free  which we werent even before covid-19 anyway.  So to think that we could be without covid is functionally not admitting the reality of the world we live in.

12/5/2021 8:07,"First, it’s “mutate.” Secondly, no, that’s not automatically what happens. If a mutated strain comes along that’s less easily spread and causes fewer symptoms then it tends to outcompete the other strains. That’s not guaranteed, and if it does happen it’s not guaranteed to happen in a timely manner, which is why vaccines play such a huge role. Lots of people can die along the way, and not all viruses mutate to become less virulent.

For example, a virus could mutate to have a one month incubation period and be 90% fatal. There’d be no real pressure on it to mutate as it would just keep spreading until there was simply no one left to carry it."

12/5/2021 7:59,"Yes. There was this guy covered on the news. He already had symptoms but tested negative. after a few days, tested again and it was positive. 

Read this article also that there's 20% chance of false negative after day 3 of symptoms (8 days of exposure).

I mean if you can afford to get tested several times, I don't think there's anything wrong with testing when you already have symptoms, it may come out positive or negative. Just be sure to test again before going out to meet people to be on the safe side and be sure that you're really negative. But for people who don't have a lot of money to spare, I guess it's better to wait a few days after developing symptoms to get tested to lessen the chance of being a false negative."

12/5/2021 7:40,"lol no. Those mutations are random. Sometimes they mutate to be far more deadly which, in the case of overachiever Covid-19, is not a problem whatsoever. Plenty of victims out there, lots of species that it can infect and reinfect. Literally zero selective pressure to be less deadly, especially with such a long incubation period. Who cares if the victim dies when you've infected several other lifeforms already?"
12/5/2021 7:40,"Honestly I think we’re at the point where hospitals simply need to adapt to the new normal, not the public.

In the Omicron situation we have something like 100 days until we can get Omicron booster doses to 60+'s.  But at the current rate of spread with high immune escape most 60+s are going to catch Omicron in 25-50 days.  We don't know how much of a problem this will be, but even in a middling-case scenario it could be a *really* big problem.

Even slowing the spread enough to get booster doses to nursing homes could save billions in hospitalization costs.  How much does limiting travel cost?"

Buying toilet paper is smart when you predict supply chain problems and have a family. It isn’t panicking. Again, look at the definition of the words.

I cannot believe that people think buying extra items during a pandemic is “panic.” That’s just incorrect. 

Running out of masks isn’t panic. 

Quarantine is when a person is literally not allowed to leave their home, which was not the case at all here. It was suggested we not make unnecessary trips, and when it was really bad in my area, it was suggested we not have people over from other households. Places like Florida literally had no rules.  

Quarantine is a word with a real definition, again, please consult a dictionary. People who were exposed or infected were suggested to quarantine for 7-10 days and very few followed the “suggestion” even after testing positive. It was very loose here, and some people tried to be careful but were free to mostly do what they wanted."

Knowing now that all healthcare staff who haven't been vaccinated are fired already, I feel safe taking them to see their doctors.

12/5/2021 7:19,"You can find anecdotal evidence of anything, honestly, even people surviving being shot in the head. I've care for hundreds... maybe thousands of COVID patients now. My personal anecdotes mean nothing as well. As of RIGHT NOW, it's 1% via all population level data. That is the number of reinfections. Hard stop. It's not going up every day because it's fixed at 1% so far. Absolute numbers are going up, yes, and at some point, they may overtake the current rate. Who knows what it'll be in the future, but right now, that's what it is. We could same the same for vaccinations. 

Your high school death rate is a false comparison. Your high school class has a 100% chance of dieing some day.  Recovered and vaccinated do not necessarily carry a lifetime risk of getting COVID infection of 100%. We don't know what it is. 

The article said omicron has 3x the reinfection risk. Right now, the rate is 1%. I showed you multiple sources that support that including Minnesota's data of 900k cases. We can argue they are likely going undiagnosed, but so are initial cases. If the 3x risk of reinfection is of the current rate, it would be 3%. I would hope they wouldnt be assuming a future hypothetical unproven rate."

Also the rate of serious illness are small even for delta ""2.3 percent of those with Delta were admitted to the hospital within two weeks of testing positive for the virus.""

Hell, my wife caught Delta after being infected with alpha, then being vaccinated. 4 months after her second vaccine dose she had mild symptomatic covid again.

You are badly misunderstanding the stats. The Italy one for example says youre 15x more likely to catch it if not prior infected.  That, however. Is a time bound measure for their study period (immunity declines with time) and it also doesn't imply only a 1% total chance of reinfection. Only a few percent of their control group caught it.  Realistically probably at least 80-90% of people can catch it if exposed. If 4.5% of your control group caught it and 0.3% of your prior infected, it means that if you exposed everyone like 85% of your control group would catch it and like 5-6% of the prior infected (but getting higher every month)."

I felt realllly funny but not super sick after attending an event but my immune system was absolutely doing something to me for a little bit, i am used to this feeling as i have an autoimmune disease that i've lived with for a few years now. I tested negative 2x on at-home tests and then took the booster a month later and it knocked me on my ass with fever for 3 days"

So ""cut off"" means you personally can't visit by your definition. Never mind the citizens, residents, foreign students and foreign teachers and foreign workers that arrive every day. 

Additional easement, including tourists, will begin in mid February after lunar new year.


>14 days of quarantine is not open. Don't delude yourself. 

Taiwan is open, there is a path for anyone approved to come to the island, arguably less restrictive than some countries that require citizenship or full vaccination. 


Next week that becomes 7 days in a quarantine hotel and will continue to ease in mid February after lunar New Year.


>And don't pretend you don't know what Mainland China is.

I'm familiar with China, just not in the context of it being a ""mainland"" of some kind.

Taiwan is a independent sovereign Democratic country, it doesn't have a ""mainland."""

one option is that more people in the area have covid. i know that sounds pedantic, but imagine this for a minute. 1% of people having covid may lead to 1% of all admissions having incidental covid, but 5% of people having covid would lead to 5% of incidental admissions having covid. 

that explains a very small part of the equation. the rest (i think) is that when someone has covid the hospital wants to keep them a bit longer ""just in case"" especially among the very young and very old who aren't going to violently plead for release. so that 5% (hypothetically) daily turns into 15-25% overall if those people are kept a bit longer and if symptoms progress then that percentage would get higher and higher."

Maybe twice, but not since May or June. I often see one or two people flouting the rules on the subway on Saturday mornings, but I think there was perfect mask wearing when I was on the train at rush hour the other day (I'm still working from home, so don't have good weekday samples)

My hypothesis is that its to do with not driving. I've forgotten a mask all of once--I put it on before leaving my apartment because otherwise I have to carry it to the subway or the shop and then put it on. My mother, who is more cautious about COVID than me, makes fun of me putting my mask on to leave the house when I've visited. Why? Because we're going to the car and driving somewhere, not walking for a couple minutes, and no one wants to wear a mask in the car for an hour."

Fast forward to 2021. The turnover is higher, the mental and physical strain is higher, and now the pay is awful for 95% of people in a hospital. Your OT/PT folks are well compensated still, that's about it. 

It's not worth the pay now to become an LPN, Medical Assistant, Rad Tech, Respiratory Therapist, Coder, and a slew of other necesaary jobs. Why go into debt to get a license/certification that won't even land you $20/hr starting off?

If it has R0 which is 20% higher(7.2), then herd immunity would be achieved at 86% of population immunised. A 20% drop in severity would be a good tradeoff, considering that prior infection might also reduce severity of your illness."

12/7/2021 12:16,"A few relevant quotes:

> Although Belgium is one of the most vaccinated countries in Europe, with a total coverage of 75 percent (87 percent of adults), Brussels is well below the national average, with just 56 percent fully vaccinated (69 percent of adults).

> Flanders has a particularly high rate: 80 percent is fully vaccinated (92 percent of adults), and Wallonia is also doing better than Brussels, with 70 percent fully vaccinated (82 percent of adults).

> These numbers also mask local variations. Within the Brussels region, it ranges from around 71 percent (around 83 percent of adults) being fully vaccinated in well-off municipalities like Woluwé-Saint-Pierre, Watermael-Boitsfort, Auderghem and Uccle, to barely 45 percent (around 55-60 percent of adults) in poorer, western neighbourhoods of Anderlecht, Saint-Josse, Koekelberg and Molenbeek.

> There is a striking correlation between wealth and vaccination: the Sciensano figures for rates across the 581 Belgian communes are very similar to those of Statbel on annual incomes. Brussels communes account for six of the 10 poorest in the country, and nine of the 10 least vaccinated.

Breastfeeding also helps, but not as much as most people think. That's because the antibodies from the milk don't get absorbed into the baby's bloodstream. So it's helpful to have some milk residue in the mouth and throat, but it's not fighting the virus from the inside, so to speak."

EDIT: I'm gonna copy a comment I made the other day because i think it's closer to the truth.

I feel like as more time is passing and the hype is dying down a little bit, the truth seems to be somewhere in between 'this is a harmless cold-like variant' and 'this is literally the end of the world as we know it.'

Bad:

Obviously spreads faster

Possibly hits children more

Vaccines do not protect against infection as much

Higher risk of reinfection

Good:

Vaccines still work against severe disease

POSSIBLY a slightly less deadly variant, judging by anecdotal reports and somewhat slower hospitalisations, though this is still hard to gauge

Antivirals will be very effective still

So we can conclude that it's not an ideal outcome, but it's still manageable. We're incredibly lucky that most of the mutations weren't in the regions that had to do with T cell evasion."

12/7/2021 11:09,3 fold would be good news. Delta was between 2 and 3.
12/7/2021 11:09,"CDC clearly doesn't say delta is definitely more virulent. They choose their words carefully. And that's because it isn't.

Those studies can easily be disproven by looking at the data in the 5 months since they were done. 

As they studied the numbers from the initial wave of delta in Canada and Scotland, and didn't account for the fact that the increased hospitalisations and subsequent death rate was due to a substantial increase in overall numbers of people becoming infected at the begging of the ""wave"", rather than a result of specific infections from the delta variant.

If you continue to look at the data from August through December for Scotland you can clearly see a downward trend in both vaccinated and unvaccinated death rates, sitting now at less than 0.1% for the unvaccinated (also majority under 16 year olds.) And 1% for the vaccinated.

That Percentage has dropped since February-july, where those two studies took their data from, and is comparable to the natural strain and alpha (beta was actually a strain that was more deadly, but it didn't gain dominance due to unfavorable mutations).

If you standardise for age, vaccinated people are safer, and that's why it's so important to vaccinate. Especially the vulnerable.

But don't come here blindly following old data, when you can actually check the numbers yourself and see if the data is still relevant 5 months later.

https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/covid-19-statistical-report/covid-19-statistical-report-1-december-2021/

The Relevant tables are normally around page 50 in those full PDF reports. You will have to search for previous monthly reports as I'm not going to spam a load of links here.

You will find they change the way they present the data a few times, one of the biggest errors in evaluation was hospitalisation and death rates as a percentage against total population of vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, and this is an incorrect use of the numbers and was changed in later publications.

You will also find they swap how they show age brackets and age standardisation of the data. The calculations for age standardisation are complicated, but aren't completely necessary to see a drop on overall hospitalisation/death rates since the beginning of the year. 

Remember it's not total number of deaths/hospitalisations, it's the percentage of total confirmed cases.  As the numbers are so close week on week for case rates, you can just compare laterally with hospitalisation and deaths. Or if you want to be more accurate to the real world outcomes you should offset your calculations by one week for hospitalisation after point of a positive test, and two weeks for death from a positive test.

Or don't do any of that and enjoy your day!"

>Dec 7 (Reuters) - British drugmaker GSK (GSK.L) said on Tuesday its antibody-based COVID-19 therapy with U.S. partner Vir Biotechnology (VIR.O) is effective against all mutations of the new Omicron coronavirus variant, citing new data from early-stage studies.

> The data, **yet to be published in a peer-reviewed** medical journal, shows that the companies' treatment, sotrovimab, is effective against all 37 identified mutations to date in the spike protein, GSK said in a statement.

>Last week, another pre-clinical data showed that the drug had worked against key mutations of the Omicron variant. Sotrovimab is designed to latch on to the spike protein on the surface of the coronavirus, but Omicron has been found to have an unusually high number of mutations on that protein. read more

> ""These pre-clinical data demonstrate the potential for our monoclonal antibody to be effective against the latest variant, Omicron, plus all other variants of concern defined to date by the WHO,"" GSK Chief Scientific Officer Hal Barron said.

> GSK and Vir have been engineering so-called pseudoviruses that feature major coronavirus mutations across all suspicious variants that have emerged so far, and have run lab tests on their vulnerability to sotrovimab treatment.

>Given the **less than three-fold neutralization shift** demonstrated in the pre-clinical pseudo-virus assay, we are confident that sotrovimab will continue to provide significant benefit for the early treatment of patients hoping to avoid the most severe consequences of COVID-19.”

Followed by another thread saying no severe cases in vaccinated patients infected with Omicrom. Feels like people here objectively want this thing to not be a big deal. People being skeptical of the emerging belief that Omicrom is definitely mild and is our ticket out of the pandemic (it’d be great if it ends up being as mild as everyone is hoping, but we already know it takes a while for covid to kill people) is not the same thing as rooting for collapse.

Also a comment on my side. Hospitalizations are way up on a few weeks ago but this is in context of them being at +-550 for a country of almost 60 million. Since they are so slow relatively they are going to increase quickly. Especially given how quickly cases have increased.

However, the numbers of hospitalisation are still fairly low. They will continue increasing  (quite quickly) but I do think this article is being a but sensationalist to claim hospitals are ""jammed""."

However, it would allow us to massively get cases under control and then mop up any cases with an mRNA possibly.

In the state of Johor where the plant is located, 9.2% were fully vaccinated. The problem then wasn't demand but supply. Malaysia was waiting on Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Sinovac to deliver more of the doses ordered to get more of the population vaccinated. Today with sufficient supply, Malaysia has achieved a vaccination rate of 78% while Johor specifically is at 80%, proving that by and large the bottleneck wasn't vaccine hesitancy but the availability of doses. So if he was not vaccinated before he caught Covid and died, it was in all likelihood because he couldn't, not because he chose not to."

Prior to even getting most of their vaccines, despite COVID peaking everywhere, Taiwan was still posting daily 0s in cases.

A lot of the criticism with their response to COVID was that they took the time they bought themselves through a good early response and pissed a lot of it away by not more aggressively purchasing or acquiring vaccines.  Even now, the vaccination rate of the nation lags behind many other nations that have handled COVID much worse.

They've survived mostly through strict regulations / restrictions and very aggressive responses to any community spread."

Most countries have back-up plans, e.g. moving patients away to less affected areas, delaying all non-essential surgeries, calling in support from other agencies (Army, Civil protection etc.) but at some point if nothing helps, you will stop treating everyone equally and go into Medical Triage, where you decide which patient have the best chances of survive and stop treating patients with low survival chance."

I honestly don't think that any variant could be deadly enough for Texas to do anything at the state level.

12/7/2021 9:33,"R0 for the flu is about 1.3. So Omicron would need an R0 of almost 8 to be 6 times as infectious as the flu. 

R0 for Delta is about 6. R0 for omicron is not known, but its Rt in certain areas appears to be about 3 at the same time Delta is 0.8. That would mean the upper-estimate of R0 would be about 22.5 (which would be the case that Omicron has no extra immune escape: its just that much more contagious). That would be about 17 times more infectious as the flu. If immune escape was 100%, that would correspond to an R0 of about 4. Which would still make it about 3 times as infectious as the flu. So Omicron is somewhere between 3 and 17 times as infectious as the flu. Given we already know Omicron has some immune escape relative to Delta, the R0=22.5 case is not realistic. So maybe the upper limit should be assumed to be more like 18 (so 14 times as infectious as the flu). 

6 is just a number I picked that was somewhere in the range of possibilities. We don't know yet. Even if its ""just"" 3 times as infectious, that still makes it very problematic. The 2009 swine flu pandemic had an R0 of about 1.5. The 1918 flu's highest estimate is 2.8 (and lowest is 1.4). Omicron is much more infectious than even the worst flus."

This is even true of our states. CO legalized weed and entire countries started doing it. Like it or not, the US leads the world. 

So there is some merit to what that guy said. Plus Biden started giving the vaccine to other countries which was a good start. Biden hasn't done shit else though, he banked on vaccine mandates and Omicron has the potential to make those plans look really useless. Biden might get lucky if it takes a while to mess us up or if Omicron is less fatal, but his big plan likely just deflated like a balloon."
12/7/2021 9:24,"Partly true.  In the UK we didn't really Dio yesterday.

Also South Africa didn't dip last week - it was around the 2000 mark.  

Deaths are often low on a Monday but I think that's more to do with processing and reporting.  Interested to see where South Africa find themselves by the end of today.  I was expecting it to be about 50 000 by the end of the week."
12/7/2021 9:24,"Another thing to take note of is that SA was unique in having an extensive wave of Beta that didn't much impact anywhere else since Alpha got other places first and outcompeted it. Beta was the most antibody evasive variant that's been characterized yet, and I of course don't know how more or less cross-reactive Beta antibodies could be against Omicron vs Alpha or Delta antibodies, but it's worth noting that the immunity profile in SA is going to look different than elsewhere."
12/7/2021 9:24,"That's not how peer review works. I think you're thinking of review paper or meta-analyses where another scientist goes through a bunch of studies on the same topic and either summarises it or analyses the combined results.

Peer review happens when a paper is submitted to a journal, and the editors send it out to 3 (usually) other scientists who have related expertise. The peer reviewers point out the flaws, the original authors try to fix the flaws, and if the editor is satisfied, the paper gets published. 

There's no continuing process whereby another 97 scientists continue to ""grade"" the paper."

Agreed. I'm still gonna try and read tea leaves. Everything below is with a huge grain of salt.

1) Omicron certainly seems more transmissible than Delta. Seeing as it's rate of spread can only be called explosive. I doubt it won't outcompete Delta in the short to mid term.

2) It seems to be better at breakthrough infections.

I think 1 & 2 are highly likely. The question is about virulence. If it was significantly less than all other variants it would be reason for relief for sure. I do doubt it though. It seems out of character for this virus that it would suddenly go to sniffles. 

If it ends up at virulence levels not significantly lower than the other strains, the result would be very very concerning indeed. Especially in locations that operate the healthcare system already at limit."

12/7/2021 9:17,"Three countries so far have the most stringent rules in place. Japan is one. Israel and Morocco are the other two. Japan has concentrated on barring foreigners as most countries have, but its entry requirements for citizens are more stringent than most. Israel's are even more so. The ultimate, however, is Morocco which has banned all incoming air travel. Simple and to the point. Morocco, by the way has the highest level of vaccination in Africa. Now I suppose you could still land a boat on the shoreline or you could try the overland trek, coming from the east. Just exchange your camel for a mule when you come to the mountains. But whatever you do, for your own good don't try coming in from the south. Lots of opportunity to get shot doing that. 

But yes, Japan has long had some very restrictive laws and practices regarding non-Japanese residents. Here, from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is [an explanation](https://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/human/race_rep1/intro.html#:~:text=Foreigners%20are%20not%20allowed%20to,permission%20of%20entry%20and%20stay.) of what is essentially a caste system, one set up to protect their 'purity'. I quote; 

>16.	Japan adopts a system of status of residence as a basic framework for foreigners to enter and stay in Japan. That is, to accept foreigners in harmony with the development of Japanese society, the Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Act sets ""the status of residence"" by categorizing activities which foreigners are authorized to engage in by entering and staying, or personal relationship or status with which foreigners are authorized to enter and stay. Foreigners are not allowed to enter or stay in Japan unless foreigners fall under any of the status of residence. Thus, the Government controls the entry and length of stay of foreigners. A foreigner is given one of the statuses upon permission of entry and stay. The Alien Registration Law requires a foreigner to register to the head of the municipalities in which his/her residence is located in order to put under proper control over the aliens residing in Japan by clarifying matters pertaining to their residence and status.


>17.	As for classification by status of residence as of the end of 1998, 41.4% of the total number of registered foreigners stay under the status of ""Special Permanent Resident"" or ""Permanent Resident,"" 17.5% stay under ""Spouse or Child of Japanese national"" and 14.0% stay under ""Long-Term Resident."" Some 7.9% of all foreigners are under the statuses with which those foreigners are allowed to work. As of the end of 1998, their number reached 118,996 which is 11,698 (10.9%) more than in the previous year. As for classification by region of origin, 91.6% of the total number of registered foreigners under ""Entertainer,"" 85.5% under ""Engineer"" and 88.2% under ""Skilled Labor"" are from Asia. Some 64.6% under ""Instructor"" and 53.7% under ""Religious Activities"" are from North America. (*6)

and

>18.	Regarding the acceptance of foreign workers, ""the Eighth Employment Measure Basic Plan"" in December 1995 in the Cabinet decided the principle as follows: the plan calls for acceptance of foreign workers in professional and technical fields as long as possible, and conditions for inspection regarding the statuses of residence should be reviewed in accordance with changes in the economic and social situation in Japan.
On the other hand, with respect to the matter of accepting workers for so-called unskilled labour, there is concern that a wide range of influences may occur in the Japanese economy and society as a result of this, such as pressure on older Japanese workers for whom employment opportunities are rather insufficient; occurrence of new dual structure in the labour market; concern about unemployment as a result of business fluctuations; occurrence of additional new social burdens; etc. These matters also have an extremely great influence upon foreign workers themselves as well as on the countries to which they belong. For these reasons, the plan requires careful consideration of this matter in accordance with consensus among the Japanese people. Based on the aforementioned policy, in principle, no foreigner is permitted to enter the country to engage in unskilled labour."

Said twisted logic thinks that people won't want to get vaccinated if they find out that there are many breakthrough cases. Instead of explaining the nuance, the government lies, hoping to influence behavior. The government thinks it's a white lie, like ""masks don't work, just wash your hands.""

The end result is the same: it causes people to trust the government less when people find out that the government has been hiding the truth."
12/7/2021 9:12,"“Neither in law nor equity can there be personal liberty to any man which shall be bondage and ruin to his fellow-men. John B.

I am a tall man with long arms which I may use at my pleasure. I may even double my fist and gesticulate at my own sweet will. But if another shall step upon the platform, and in the exercise of my personal liberty I bring my fist against his face, I very soon find that my personal liberty ends where that man’s nose begins.’”

Also, if you’re interested in precedent set regarding vaccine mandates (at least in the United States) you should look into the case Jacobson v. Massachusetts. It is the basis of why schools are authorized to not admit students to class without receiving certain vaccines. 

I’m sure you think this is some conspiracy for the government to take your rights away, but this has been precedent for over 100 years, has been enacted plenty of times. There’s no complacency or things being shoved down your throat, nor anyone else’s. 

You’re also gravely mistaken if you think individual freedoms allow people to put others in danger unnecessarily without some consequence. I never said ALL laws were for public safety, I said MOST were. One’s individual freedom cannot infringe on another’s."

Old and fat people have low vitamin D and have bad outcomes from COVID, but it does not mean vitamin D is at all responsible for the severity of the illness. Being old and fat were the reasons.

If you’re worried about your micronutrients, go talk to your doctor about your diet, but don’t start a supplement that almost certainly has no impact just because someone told you to online.

And theres still a lot to study about how this particle behaves and how easy it is for it to cause an infection and replicate. And where does being more contagious come from? Does it resist more time outside of the body than previous strains meaning it stays active on surfaces for longer? Is the viral load so big that it reaches more people? Is it easier to shed meaning that youre throwing a lot of particles in the air? Does being contagious start earlier or with less noticeable symptoms on the incubation period?

12/7/2021 8:10,"I agree that it isn't totally predictable, I mostly meant that this path was the one that seemed most probable given the situation.

The other trouble is that the human immune system isn't a computer - we can't just reprogram it willy nilly. The vaccines need to be different enough that the body treats it as wholly novel, otherwise it can rely on its existing responses to try and fight again. Too close & you risk mounting a pretty anemic response. 

The predictability doesn't come from periodicity here. It comes from a generalized ""push and pull"" view of things. Diseases don't get discouraged or regroup, they expand or contract. *Either* the disease finds a new foothold for expansion or it continues to wane, so the pressures you put on the disease dictate the most advantageous footholds.

The worst thing to do with a disease at the population scale is to mount a strong but inconclusive defense. Either the disease is defeated or it overcomes your defenses."

Two different species of flying mammals might both be called ""bats"" but on a scale of genetic difference, this might be like just calling all four-legged mammals ""horses"" be them cows or polar bears.  So therefore coronaviruses evolved infecting a broad range of animals."

Also, the degree of change here is highly dependent on our behavior to contain it.

We do know if necessary we can make new vaccines with modified spike proteins in relatively short order if necessary. If this had all happened in the 70s we'd be fucked."
12/7/2021 7:45,How can they do more?
12/7/2021 7:44,"Via Black Magic, geneticists can tell with a given probability how close two lineages are, or if one is descended from the other.  My guess would be irrelevant mutations (that don't change the amino acid) let them tell how many generations are between two sequences.  This lets us say that a certain sequence is a descendant of the other, for instance with the first ever US case (quarantined) that was later determined to be the direct ancestor of all the early 2020 cases in Washington State.

This leads to the entire ancestry tree, which you've probably seen in pictoral form such as [this](https://www.kqed.org/science/1964010/big-push-probing-virus-genomes-for-clues-to-contain-covid-19-outbreaks) or [this](https://www.geekwire.com/2020/genetic-sleuths-flesh-story-coronavirus-got-start-washington/).  It gets a lot more complicated as the tree gets bigger and eventually is too big for anyone to remember it all, of course.

What we've seen with *every* VOC is that they have appeared fully-formed with a large amount of mutations, and their closest direct ancestors have always B.1 (the d614g lineage that spread around the world) or a closely related lineage (like B.1.1 or B.1.1.28). These are conjectured to be the result of competitive evolution in a persistent infection in a single, likely immunocompromised, host with long-term infection.  There have been many case studies showing this sort of evolution, such as [here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.13.20231217v1), but the actual origin of each VOC is just conjecture.  The other possibility for a high degree of evolution without intermediate samples is evolution within a non-human species, as was seen in Cluster 5, but prior to Omicron nearly all of the individual mutations we've observed in VOCs are ones observed multiple times in different lineages (E484K is a common example as it has arisen many times and even been observed mutating in human hosts).

With Delta something we haven't seen before happened: B.1.617 is the known ancestor of B.1.617.1 (Kappa), B.1.617.2 (Delta), and B.1.617.3.  But B.1.617 itself was never (to my layman's knowledge) sequenced.  The strong implication is that they all had a common ancestor in the original long-term host who shed (at least) three different lineages as they evolved within that person.  It's worth noting that Kappa was observed first, then the more contagious Delta, then the much less contagious B.1.617.3.  This happened just because of when they were shed and their rate of spread: more contagious variants might be detected later if they evolve and are shed later and then caught up.

What we're seeing here could be similar.  But Omicron (B.1.1.529.1) is not anything like any previous VOC, at all.  The number of mutations between these two differences is quite large: 18 differences in the spike protein alone is about as far apart *as any other two lineages we've seen*.  And this ""new"" lineage has far more non-spike mutations than Omicron, though all of the ""important"" spike mutations are shared between them.  Omicron's high density of spike mutations has already been noted, so I have no idea at all what this entirely different distribution means."

12/7/2021 7:43,"I got Pfizer for shot one and then J&J for shots 2 & 3. No idea how well protected I am, but this is looking good. I had to switch from mRNA because of an allergic reaction."
12/7/2021 7:42,"Delta is still present in SA, which has a very low vaccination rate"
12/7/2021 7:42,"Not really. The presymptomatic period is long enough that simply maximising spread over this period is probably optimal, and are plenty of asymptomatic COVID cases who spread it throughout their whole infectious period anyway.

It also depends on what actually makes a specific variant more transmissible. Delta was more transmissible than other strains due to an increased viral load, and as a result was significantly more deadly. There's no selection pressure for it to become less virulent because in this case that would mean it was also less transmissible."
12/7/2021 7:42,"Too simplistic. Imagine you lived in Soviet Russia, and the government trotted out a scientist telling you that potatoes where great for health, and you should eat more of them. Would you trust or believe that guy? Or would you go home and eat as little potatoes as you could for a while? And what would be the informed(as opposed to ignorant) choice in your eyes?

This is how many people see their governments today. It doesn't matter if you stick a PhD in front of someone's name, it's the connection to untrusted authorities that is the problem.

If that's deserved or not is another debate. It's more complex than ignorance tho - proof in the fact that a lot of these people TRY to find more info, but can't allow themselves to believe the information that agrees with the government, so they fall for the conspiracies instead. Again, distrust in authorities driving misinformation."

12/7/2021 7:41,"Dec. 5, 2021
People who received Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines may get as much benefit from a Johnson & Johnson booster shot as a Pfizer one. That’s the finding of a small study released on Sunday.

Researchers at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston studied 65 people who had received two shots of the Pfizer vaccine. Six months after the second dose, the researchers gave 24 of the volunteers a third dose of the Pfizer vaccine and gave 41 the Johnson & Johnson shot. (The study was funded in part by Johnson & Johnson and has not yet been published in a scientific journal.)

Both vaccine brands boosted the number of Covid-fighting T-cells, which are important for long-lasting protection and for preventing infections from turning into severe disease. But the T-cell increase delivered by the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was twice as high as that of Pfizer’s.

The researchers also measured antibodies, which provide much of the protection immediately after vaccination. Volunteers who got a third Pfizer dose saw their antibody levels jump after two weeks, and then decline by a quarter by the fourth week. The Johnson & Johnson booster, by contrast, more than doubled antibody levels between the second and fourth weeks. At that point, Pfizer’s antibodies were still about 50 percent higher than Johnson & Johnson’s. For antibodies, that’s a relatively small difference. And both levels were well above the threshold scientists believe is needed for strong protection.

The results are somewhat different from earlier studies. In October, a “mix and match” clinical trial organized by the National Institutes of Health reported that all three authorized vaccines — from Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson — caused antibody levels to rise when used as a booster. But Johnson & Johnson’s shot provided a much smaller boost than the others did. (The N.I.H. has not yet published how each booster affected the volunteers’ T-cells.)

The difference between the two studies might be explained by the length of delay between shots. In the N.I.H. trial, many of the volunteers got their booster shots after three or four months, versus the new study’s wait of six months.

The Johnson & Johnson vaccine seems to have benefited more from the longer wait. Unlike Pfizer and Moderna, which are made from mRNA, Johnson & Johnson’s is made from a modified cold virus. It may be important to give the immune system more time to return to a resting state before getting this type of vaccine."

South Africa is highly affected bcz most of the population is unvaccinated."
12/7/2021 7:25,"My clinic has lost a lot of people. All of our admissions crew (ALL of them), about half of our med techs, maybe 1/3 of our doctors. We have not been able to recruit new doctors, really, so we added a third provider to each clinic - midlevels which our clinic director was STAUNCHLY against until covid beat down morale. Our providers have 10-15 minutes per patient. For EVERYTHING. That's chart review, meeting patient, documenting, running tests, prescribing meds, and putting together dismissal info. Imagine your doctor trying to do all of that and also sew up your laceration or lance your abscess, all in 15 minutes! Physicians were already sick to death of all the documenting and CYA, sick to death of being worked like machines on 20 minute patient slot timelines. Covid has compounded the issue. There is NEVER a break anymore. There are no slow days. Summers used to be a quiet season following the winter cold/flu patient spikes, but we're full up year round. Most of our doctors are veterans of the ED... trying to spend their last 10-15 years of career at a slower pace before retiring... MANY physicians opted for early retirement. The midlevels who have stepped in - just months ago - are already beaten down by the constant onslaught. Our first NP comes to work with a 12 oz coffee and won't drink it until 10 hours into her shift because she says it'll make her need to pee and she doesn't have time to pee. Most of the doctors fast through their shift because there is no time to be hungry, no time to eat, definitely 100% never time to leave the premise to pick food up. The nurses are constantly in a bad mood because patients are pissed off about the long wait times and are flat out mean. We get screamed at every single day from patients mad about wait times, mad because they wanted tests we don't have, mad because we didn't prescribe the things they want. Techs spend all day running, running, running, trying to keep up with constant admissions, new vital signs for the patients who have been waiting more than an hour, running tests. As soon as we hire new techs, every week, some leave. Luckily now we're getting ED techs at the clinic :) They're great but we only get them because they can't tolerate the ED anymore! So the ED is running with 1/4 of the pods closed because there is no staff! We aren't even swamped with covid right now, we're not even seeing flu yet, but people *won't use the free freaking drive through testing sites they keep coming in wtf more can we do to encourage you to USE THE FREAKING DRIVE THROUGH TESTING SITES THEY ARE FREE PLEASE STOP COMING HERE FOR JUST A TEST* ***WE ARE OVERWHELMED YOU CAN DO THIS WITHOUT US DON'T CHECK IN*** ugh. It is just exhausting.   


I've typed this rant up like a dozen times on reddit but I usually delete it. We have it better than some of the healthcare settings. We're not in the ICU, so we don't deal with constant alarms and daily covid deaths. We're not in the ED so we do eventually get to close our doors and go home. We transfer the really bad cases (we are seeing a lot of the people who would usually go to the ED but the wait times are so long they come to us instead, which means we're just transferring them back to where they would have been already, but whatev). Dialysis is constantly decked out in PPE, which we don't have to do, so that's nice. But it's still ... it's just a matter of time until there are no people left to work. We will run out of potential staff. We will have to close one clinic to staff the other. We will be in dire straights when covid really picks up again, or when the FLU picks up, because we're already above capacity in the ED, in the urgent care, in the primary care. There is nowhere left for patients to go. 

And *none* of our staff, not a single one, has left to be a travel nurse. We'll take extra money, and we *deserve* extra money, but improving the work environment is absolutely pivotal. No amount of money is going to make up for the helpless, hopeless, condition of our healthcare system."

Neither lineage really appears to be older than the other.

My understanding was it offered very good protection against infection of initial variants, and still offered some protection for Delta.  Omicron it’s unclear if there’s any protection left on that front or if it’s just combatting symptoms."
12/7/2021 7:17,Why would they be in the hospital then?
12/7/2021 7:17,"It's been discovered that there are two very distinct lineages of Omicron. 

They share ~35 mutations.  
The SGTF version has an additional 20 mutations.  
The newly discovered one has an additional 25 mutations.  

Most of the [assumed] most biologically important mutations seem to be shared, but there's still a lot of spike mutations that are not shared. And of course, this new lineage NOT having SGTF means we won't be able to identify it with just PCR. 

I have no idea why something like this exists though. Kinda creeps me out.    
I'm guessing the theory will still be chronically infected person(s), but I feel it's a bit weaker of an idea with this new development.    
This one's first sequence date is just 9 days after the SGTF version of Omicron."

Roger Template, 8 December 2021, /r/nottheonion 

Snow Leopard Bartha Memorialized as a ""Raging Asshole""

A 32-year-old snow leopard named Bartha died of COVID-19 at Whipsnade Zoo.  The occasion was marked by a unanimous sigh of relief from any employee who had ever come into line of sight of her.

""She had a skill of looking adorable and purring up to 37.8 cm distance"", said junior keeper Jonah Placekeeper.  ""One millimeter closer, and it was even odds whether you'd catch a claw in your face.  She was 15% more accurate than a laser rangefinder.""

Two years ago, Whipsnade changed their incident reporting form to add a checkbox ""Injured by Bartha"" as the first line under ""Cause"".  They also allowed forms to be filled out in blood.  The zoo estimated that these changes saved 3.2 aggregate staff hours per year.

""I had never described a zoo animal as 'vile' before, and I once met Mpon'n'gani, the notorious serial-rapist orangutan at the Smithsonian National Zoo"", senior keeper Peggy Filler said.  ""I am certain that Bartha has her own circle of hell.""

Deputy administrator Nigel Blank agreed.  ""If you had a dump truck worth of evil, ran it through the biggest French press in the world, and poured the resulting brew into a mould of a snow leopard, you'd get Bartha.  Except anyone here would make sure you had a fatal accident with the rhino-sized band castrator if you tried.""

A memorial service is planned, being designed as ""the most massive knees-up in Whipsnade history"".

Disposal of her remains remains controversial.  One faction believes it most fitting for the Archbishop of Canterbury to bless one of the ponds made from a bomb crater, to dump her remains in.  Another faction believes that that would likely cause a massive explosion.  They suggest placing her remains in a baptised church bell, burying it face-down in a crossroads at high noon on Christmas Day.  Either way, the Most Revd. Justin Welby is currently being fitted with the first liturgical PPE armour in Anglican history."
12/7/2021 6:56,Yeah pretty much. The article on hospitalizations has 10x the upvotes as this one already. Either some asshole is paying for votes to push a narrative or lots of fuckers here want maximum chaos so they can feel better about their own shitty lives.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grievance\_studies\_affair

""Taking place over 2017 and 2018, their project entailed submitting bogus papers to academic journals in cultural, queer, race, gender, fat, and sexuality studies to determine whether they would pass through peer review and be accepted for publication. Several of these papers were subsequently published.""  


""Boghossian, Lindsay, and Pluckrose wrote 20 articles that promoted deliberately absurd ideas or morally questionable acts and submitted them to various peer-reviewed journals. Although they had planned for the project to run until January 2019, the trio admitted to the hoax in October 2018 after journalists from The Wall Street Journal revealed that ""Helen Wilson"", the pseudonym used for their article published in Gender, Place & Culture, did not exist. By the time of the reveal, 4 of their 20 papers had been published; 3 had been accepted but not yet published; 6 had been rejected; and 7 were still under review.""

  
If you lie in a way that appeals to the biases and prejudices of those reviewing your work, you're far more likely to get ahead than if you do legitimate work and have boring results or WORSE results that contradict the gatekeeper's world view. 7 Publications vs 6 rejections is pretty good considering the author had 0 reputation and the content was literal non-sense."

12/7/2021 6:32,"Yeah. The \~13% increase in total cases only means \~13% increase in total deaths with serious strong interventions to lower Rt, so hospitals aren't overwhelmed.

I ended up breaking down into tears one night talking to my partner. Things had barely started, but it was already obvious that a ton of people were gonna die needlessly. I could hear my neighbor huff at me & close their window (I was outside) and it just rubbed the salt in deeper.

It became ""politics"", so a ton of people vehemently denied it existing and a ton more were infuriated by the idea that *your* political opinions should have an impact on *my life*. The cavalier disregard for science & the wellbeing of others was too much for me.

Also, the low-ball estimates of the Spanish Flu and the second worse bubonic plague epidemics are much much lower than the high estimates meaning both were probably much worse.

>Some data suggest the Delta variant might cause more severe illness than previous variants in unvaccinated people. In two different studies from Canada and Scotland, patients infected with the Delta variant were more likely to be hospitalized than patients infected with Alpha or the original virus that causes COVID-19

So that's from the CDC and references multiple studies.

Same for smoking. If smoking cigarettes or drinking alcohol had a clear correlation to Covid deaths I’d say the same thing.

12/7/2021 6:11,"You're correct that immunocompromized folks can play host to multiple variants, increasing the chance novel variants arise in their bodies-- However this can happen in folks with regular immune systems too as well.

The part of the selection the vaccinated population controls is to provide a ""proving ground"" where only the least viral-load reliant spreaders could flourish... because vaccinated folks can't carry big viral loads. Our immune systems respond to COVID orders of magnitude faster as they've been pre-primed with instructions from the vaccine.

That means the ""ideal"" profile for a viral profile from the virus' evolutionary survival standpoint is a variant that minimizes the need for a deep, severe infection in order to spread.

Isn't the current theory that it evolved in an immunocompromised person?  Lingering and changing as their weakened immune system tried to keep up with the changes.  

At least some of the theories say it has stuff that came from a common cold (some of which are also corona viruses), apparently viruses coexisting in a given cell can swap their dna bits.  (I'd guess that it requires them being in the same family though, so hopefully herpes and covid can't mutate together.)

If all that's true, wouldn't the presence of an immunocompromised person means our vaccination percentage means fuckall if we can't keep all of them fully isolated for an extended period of time?  Otherwise, someone who got infected in July while getting cancer treatments can spread a brand new, vaccine ignoring, covid in March.

It's really not like say ebola, which is so deadly when it jumps to humans that it doesn't have time to mutate to a less deadly form before it burns itself out."
12/7/2021 5:54,">As businesses across New York City grappled on Monday with Mayor Bill de Blasio’s new mandate that all private employers soon require their workers to be vaccinated, the consensus in one neighborhood seemed to be support for the requirement but skepticism about enforcement.

>”It just seems logical, but I think the pushback will be huge,” said Andy Churchill, the brand director of Canine Styles, a pet grooming salon on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.

>At Canine Styles, Mr. Churchill said, the owner required all employees to be vaccinated as soon as they were eligible. He said that no one resisted, but that he was not sure if other businesses would have such an easy time.

>Under New York City’s new mandate for private employers, employees who work in-person at private companies must have one dose of the vaccine by Dec. 27. Remote workers will not be required to get the vaccine. There is no testing option as an alternative.

>Charlie Fernandez, general manager of Harry’s Shoes on the Upper West Side, said the vast majority of the store’s employees had gotten vaccinated. One or two chose to do weekly testing instead.

>”If you want to increase business, you need to have everybody vaccinated,” Mr. Fernandez said.

>He said he didn’t know how officials would monitor compliance.

>Charlie Rath, a sales associate at the wine store Pour, wondered if the city was going to send workers around to every business and ask every employee to show proof of vaccination. He also questioned the rationale of a vaccine mandate for employees of private businesses but not the customers who frequent them.

>Andrew Rigie, the executive director of the NYC Hospitality Alliance, a trade group for the city’s restaurant industry, called on Mr. de Blasio to delay the requirement until 2022 because it could be difficult for some people to comply.

>”Public health and safety is paramount, but Mayor de Blasio’s announced expansions to the Key to NYC vaccine mandate pose additional challenges for an already beleaguered restaurant industry in need of tourism support and revenues this holiday season,” Mr. Rigie said. “U.S. families visiting New York City for scheduled holiday vacations may not be able to meet the vaccination requirements for children or themselves in time, and children aged 5-11 across the globe aren’t universally authorized to get vaccinated.”

>Lincoln Neto, the manager of Basics Plus Hardware and Houseware on the Upper West Side, said that all nine of his employees were vaccinated and that “if it was up to me, I would say you need to get vaccinated, and if not, then unfortunately I have to let you go.” But he said he had mixed feelings about a citywide mandate because he believed the decision should be left up to individual business owners.

>Mr. Churchill of Canine Styles also questioned the mayor’s decision to put the mandate into effect just days before handing the office over to Eric Adams.

>”I think it’s de Blasio’s last-ditch effort to go out with a bang,” he said.

12/7/2021 5:54,"Yes, the scientist concludes that it spreads faster but is less deadly. It has already been spread in [38 countries but no deaths](https://www.easterneye.biz/who-says-no-omicron-deaths-yet-as-variant-spreads-worldwide/) so far.
We should take precautions and wear masks and distance in the crowd.
Omicron spreads faster than delta variant."
12/7/2021 5:54,"The news yesterday: ""Omicron has nobody dead or hospitalized!"" 

The news today: ""South African Hospitals flooded with Omicron!"""
12/7/2021 5:54,Wouldn’t being able to spread throughout the entire illness as opposed to a shorter window right before symptoms start be that pressure?
12/7/2021 5:54,"There's also a good chance that uncontrolled spread of Omicron would lead to further mutations and start the whole damn thing over again, possibly in more severe form. (And that's a good scenario, a worse scenario is that Omicron sparks a new variant \*and\* does a lot of damage on its own)

To think that Omicron is good because it will harmlessly immunize everyone  requires ignoring how poorly that idea has worked over the past two years."
12/7/2021 5:53,">This comment confuses me.

It confuses you because it is completely incorrect and false.  No idea why that person got 200+ upvotes trying to gaslight us into ""remembering"" when Delta coverage was no big deal.   lol"
12/7/2021 5:53,"It should be more accurate to say that larger people are more likely to spread the virus.

Or is that body shaming?

Instead, we'll just say ""men"" because it is acceptable."
12/7/2021 5:53,Sorry. I just dont give a shit anymore.

12/7/2021 5:52,"Lots of 3 year olds dying of Covid?  I hadn’t heard. 

In any case, how are vaccinated people going to a movie, bar or restaurant effecting your 3 year old exactly?

I have family members on immunosuppressants. They have to be more careful with their risk profile. 

With my risk profile (vaccinated, healthy weight, reasonably young) the odds of death are higher for my car ride to visit them than they are for dying of Covid. 

I also test every single time before seeing them. 

That seems reasonable to me."
12/7/2021 5:52,"Data seems to check out, but the most recent report is dated 7th and not 5th, so the last increase in icu/intubation isn't as steep as they make it sound."
12/7/2021 5:52,"Yup, same here... I'm hoping they'll keep us at home for awhile longer. We're only supposed to be going back as hybrid anyway, but I'd really prefer that we delay that. We've had recent management changes though, which has me concerned :/"
12/7/2021 5:52,"Bayesian techniques are usually mentioned indirectly, i.e. saying that population was this, this % had covid, now based on the survey, expected likelihood is that % etc"
12/7/2021 5:50,"This is fantastic news! From reading all these articles, it looks like this pandemic might be coming to an end with the virus mutating to be no more serious than a common cold"
12/7/2021 5:50,Okay but comparing the bans to apartheid is also ridiculous.
12/7/2021 5:50,Nothing in that statement proves or expresses that Delta is deadlier.

12/7/2021 5:49,"We don't know how much safer you will be from Omicron if you get a booster.

But we do know that you *will* be safer. So you should go ahead and get it, because even if we need Omicron specific boosters it will be months before we have them ready."
12/7/2021 5:49,Any deaths at all linked to it?
12/7/2021 5:48,"I had 20/cardiac arrests in 18 hours only 3 days after my 2nd Moderna, and I don't have any preexisting conditions, nor previous heart problems. I was a healthy 32 yo male. You're not alone. I have a SICD now, and I have had 4 more cardiac arrests since my initial collapse. I just had a ventricular ablation to help get my PVCs caused by the vax under control."
12/7/2021 5:48,"Spread in SA in people with natural immunity and the high correlation between natural and vaccine derived immunity escape. Rapid increase of cases in highly vaccinated countries like Norway (72% vaxed), or UK where 50% of cases are in double vaxxed (population 69% vaxxed and figure includes positibe travellers from low vax southern Africa)."
12/7/2021 5:48,"Yes, I am. My mistake."
12/7/2021 5:48,"No clue how they are doing things there. But I had a friend get the original covid in Oklahoma and go to the hospital because he was struggling to breathe. They put him on oxygen for six hours and sent him home. He was never ""admitted"". If they aren't admitting people with mild symptoms, this is huge news."
12/7/2021 5:47,"China wasn’t transparent and downplayed the severity of covid at the start, then international spread happened and everyone realised the hell storm that came to us. Not sure about South Africa, but it certainly seems that they have been more transparent than China, especially about notifying us about the variant to begin with."
12/7/2021 5:47,"The problem here is that the us healthcare is broken because they let market make decisions. I’m not saying in my country things are completely different, reality is that nurses and doctors have some leverage in the United States… here maybe normal care continues while covid is a thing but we continue to have little leverage when asking for raises and improved labor conditions."
12/7/2021 5:47,There’s political issues in Malaysia but no coup. Are you thinking of Myanmar?
12/7/2021 5:46,Man the last 21 months have been pretty damn relaxing. IT working from home introvert right here.
12/7/2021 5:45,"Fuck that, halt admission for non vaccinated Covid patients unless they have a medical reason they can't take the vaccine.  Don't want to do your part, ride it out at home."
12/7/2021 5:45,"""Other populations""? Were elephants and gorillas included in the study as well?"
12/7/2021 5:45,Yup. And Abbott needs to prove he's pro-covid enough for Texans for November. Maybe he'll mandate Omicron infections this time to one-up his absurd EOs.
12/7/2021 5:43,"It’s so new that hospitalizations would be rare and deaths nearly impossible. 

It’s rare to catch covid and die the next day. Often 10-14 days to hospitalization, then 2-60 days til death."
12/7/2021 5:43,One min we have an article saying that the hospitals have not had a surge and is likely a mild variant. Now the hospitals in South Africa are packed. We need much better reporting and some better data and information. This is the type of ammo so many skeptic and anti-vax people use to make there case.
12/7/2021 5:43,ah ok.
12/7/2021 5:43,Yeah. Nebraska being so quick was a big surprise.
12/7/2021 5:41,"I don't know why you're being downvoted.

Ignorance is the ""lack of knowledge or information"".

Not sure how this wouldn't fit the definition."
12/7/2021 5:41,There was a tool that didn't care about ending the pandemic. At least he's not president anymore.
12/7/2021 5:41,we've got a better chance of getting all the deer vaccinated.
12/7/2021 5:40,"It’s helping in Florida, isn’t it.
The only thing that allows accurate predictions is good data on this variant, of which we don’t have any yet."
12/7/2021 5:40,Bosses have less power right now than they have in decades.
12/7/2021 5:39,It would also allow for the possibility it's better. Every hopeful comment or post is down voted.
12/7/2021 5:38,"This exactly. And being more mild might actually make things worse. If say, 5% of people have serious symptoms instead of 10%, but the virus is many times more transmissible, you still end up with more people in the hospital. 

A small percentage of nearly 8 billion is still a huge number of people."
12/7/2021 5:38,My son just started school this year. I'd say he has missed nearly half of it from getting sick. I get weekly alerts of a covid case at the school. I need to stop feeling guilty when I keep him home.
12/7/2021 5:38,"It was to the ""nature doesn't work that way"" comment."
12/7/2021 5:38,"Can we start calling ""lack of trust in science"" what it actually is?

Ignorance.

Whether that ignorance is intentional or a result of poor education, it is still ignorance."
12/7/2021 5:38,"That’s an opinion about where we are right now not a prediction using a transparent estimation method.  Opinions aren’t predictions.  

While it probably makes no difference as your opinion or mine has zero effects on those that actually are trying to plan for things like this, thinking that one’s opinion with the confidence you espouse is not really helping anyone, is it?"
12/7/2021 5:37,"Instead of blaming the media, why not blame the politicians who politicized it? In specific, The American Republican party, most members of the party who subscribe to ""Party over Country"", and Trump who said that the virus was a ""Democratic Hoax""."
12/7/2021 5:37,"This pandemic has shown that some humans really have a god complex. Nature is powerful and we are seeing it first hand. Every action we take, there seems to be a reaction (like Delta & Omicron which threw major spanners). I think this author needs to accept that it is just not possible to get global cooperation to completely solve this issue. Just as we have not been able to solve poverty or war conflicts. Half the planet lives without food and COVID is the least of their problems."
12/7/2021 5:37,It's already here and it's here to stay.
12/7/2021 5:37,"Why were they in a zoo, anyway"
12/7/2021 5:37,This is definitely one of the weirder news articles I’ve seen on here
12/7/2021 5:37,"I don’t know if they have professional credentials or if they’re just two guys that like to make spreadsheets, but the data is put up every day at https://www.nicd.ac.za/ 

I think https://www.nicd.ac.za/diseases-a-z-index/disease-index-covid-19/surveillance-reports/daily-hospital-surveillance-datcov-report/ is the correct specific link, but it’s not loading for me right now.  Unsurprisingly, they’ve had a lot of server issues this week."
12/7/2021 5:35,"i was thinking about this, people seem to think that it will be good if omicron is fast moving but low severity, but if omicron doesn't give you protection against delta infection , then it doesnt help much , it just adds on like a seperate minor pandemic on top of our main one"
12/7/2021 5:35,Didn't Malaysia also go through a coup during COVID? I think there is more at play than just COVID.
12/7/2021 5:35,"Yes, it's a capacity on how many people you can have at your house. The maximum from my knowledge is no more than 2 families( households) , and they have to be vaxxed. It's pretty stupid because stadiums can have over 30,000 people, but you can't have more than 2 families in your own home. The idea was that since private gatherings are less likely to check vaccinations and are less regulated, they are more likely a risk. It's mostly guidance though and no one has really been following it since there is no enforcement."
12/7/2021 5:34,"These must be separate shedding events from the same original host, right?  No way that kind of mutation just pops up quickly with the small number of hosts the current Omicron has had.

EDIT: That's a *lot* of changed mutations."
12/7/2021 5:34,"They’ll raise reimbursement levels, wink and a nod between legislators and their donors.

Then they’ll raise wages 1$ an hour, only for new hires, no one will take the jobs, still, but the agency will still make a premium for every client they were already serving. Then they’ll bring in the National guard or declare an emergency, and the tax payers will foot the bill a 2nd time as the state goes begging the National government for handouts.

If they don’t tie the reimbursements to increasing ‘patients served’ this will just be a giant grift. I’m 99% sure it will be.

Source:  Nurse who has worked with & for home health agencies."
12/7/2021 5:34,"Some humans always survive. Maybe even a majority. But the size of the sick minority radically alters society and culture and the survivors.

A disease doesn't have to kill us all to be absolutely destructive.

Decimate derives from one/tenth.

If 10% die society is decimated. Literally. Radical change ensues.

In the greater scheme if things 90% survive...but do you want to experience that particular paradigm shift firsthand?"
12/7/2021 5:34,Which is a bummer because they’re the only cruise line I’m aware of that requires 100% vaccination with no exceptions.
12/7/2021 5:33,"Kind of both. COVID hospitalizations are definitely up, 1.6 thousand in Gauteng. By comparison, in July they had 7k COVID patients in the province admitted, in a province of 12.2 million people. 
This thing that baffles me though is that South Africa also reports how many of these patients require oxygen. Right now, it's only about 1/6 of the inpatients. If 5/6 don't require oxygen, why are they there?
When I admit patients FOR COVID, 95% or more of the time, it is for oxygen needs. If they have COVID in the hospital but are not on oxygen, in the USA at least, it's almost always an incidental discovery through asymptomatic testing for other reasons. 
So, in short, yes, more people are coming for COVID alone, but there be many more incidental discoveries. At least that's what it appears to me. 

And regardless, the situation could change at any time."
12/7/2021 5:32,Yep it was 28 percent before omicron and the primary vaccine was Astrazeneca. The vaccinate rate is up now but it still takes about two weeks to innoculate.
12/7/2021 5:32,This person is just going to have an excuse for everything. youre wasting your time
12/7/2021 5:32,"I would guess that there is at least one approved vaccine for that age range and that those people are to be vaccinated, but that they're not covered by the distribution strategy yet."
12/7/2021 5:32,I would get more wine.
12/7/2021 5:31,"I know someone who not only refuses to get vaccinated but even refuses to get tested which is something they offered to them and ONLY them in lieu of vaccination because of their position. Their rationale is that the tests have cancer causing agents and they refuse to use them, yet this person is routinely up to their elbows in grease, in close proximity to exhaust fumes and lord knows what else. I’ve never encountered such a frightening level of ignorance before."
12/7/2021 5:30,No one WANTS it to be worse! But rational discussion allows for the realistic possibility that it is.
12/7/2021 5:29,"We're pretty much on a relatively predictable schedule where the emerging variant is more capable of bypassing existing immunity and/or is more transmissible among young people/children. That's just where the evolutionary pressures are pushing it.

Months ago my guess was that we'd have a variant along those lines pop up, spread during the holiday season, and then spread among kids at school coming back from holiday, making late January/February around the time hospitals start to see a truly horrible rush of kids.

Fingers crossed that Omicron isn't particularly contagious to youngsters. How many kids under 5 have to be in daycare so their parents can work?"
12/7/2021 5:29,">people who are not at risk (after vaccination, the vast majority of the population)

Don't want to bet on this. Viruses binding to ACE-2 receptors are always bad news and has a great potential in terms of lethality."
12/7/2021 5:29,"No, you’re being dismissive due to your assumptions, I’m simply providing alternative scenarios that highlight why you’re assumptions may not be correct"
12/7/2021 5:29,"Please, enough with this theory. SOMETIMES. Not mostly, not always."
12/7/2021 5:29,I'll ask here as well: who are Steve Miller & bentamy? Can we crosscheck their data?
12/7/2021 5:29,"If this strain is more deadly than Delta and more transmissable, this will pack hospitals unlike any wave we've seen yet for obvious reasons. Add ""COVID fatigue,"" schools re-opening, holiday gatherings, and states with lax mask and vaccination policies, and it's not a pretty picture. I know Florida, especially Southwest, and if this is more communicable and more deadly than Delta, I don't want to go out the front door for a long while."
12/7/2021 5:28,Harmless is definitely a relative term here too...
12/7/2021 5:28,100% this.

12/8/2021 9:43,"Wouldn't say it's the final nail.  First, people who were previously infected + vaccinated seem to be ok here (so not a clear case for boosters for them).  And the authors are just assuming boosters should bump up 2dose vaccinated individuals to the previously infected + vaccinated level, but there is no actual data yet.  Finally - this doesn't measure tcell response; it could be that tcell response does most of the heavy lifting from the prevention of serious disease aspect that we all want."
12/8/2021 9:41,"I really struggle with this too. Everything is open where I live, so it must be safe enough, but it still feels totally irresponsible to go out and do anything. Even something as simple as going shopping or eating in a restaurant still feels dangerous/irresponsible and I constantly have the fear of “But if we make plans for the weekend, what if we go into lockdown between now and then?” 

Something that helped me was forcing myself to travel. It was really scary at first because, with omicron, there’s a legitimate possibility of a lockdown. Once I got to my destination, though, I felt like my old self and it was really wonderful. It was the first time in a while where I believed I’d be okay."

12/8/2021 9:37,"Weirdly enough my psychiatrist was saying it was actually moderating the mental health of the majority of his patients, especially those with serious diagnoses. He also said the average person was a little worse off, but those who were having crises aggravated by the pandemic were far, far worse than they were pre-pandemic. I'm not arguing by any means that the pandemic was actually good for mental health, but as a natural experiment, there might be some clues towards improving the lives of people with serious diagnoses."

12/8/2021 9:35,"There is also a group of people that don't want to be incubators for a pandemic, and don't want to spread it.

Period. 

Each time it gets passed around, it gets another chance to mutate into something that is entirely avoidant of the current vaccines, then we get to start at square one again.

That's not ""listening to the news all day"", or even living in fear, that's understanding exactly what we're up against."

12/8/2021 9:29,"Authoritarianism is a real thing that exists many places in the world.  This is what some critics call a ""nanny state""

France has an Authoritarian democracy. Their president can exercise a pretty incredible amount of control over every French individual with a stroke of the pen. That's why they are able to do some of the countermeasures we were not able to do within our system. 

Some people prefer that style of government. Many do not.  Doesn't matter what anyone's opinion is. It exists

It is describing a governing system with a great deal if authority. American presidents/ federal government don't have much authority over individuals. Compared to most other democracies"
12/8/2021 9:29,"The first step is acknowledging that the design of the government is bad and an obstacle to doing good things, whether you resolve that by breaking the “rules” (which are all made up) and ignoring dumbass judges or whether you waste time with constitutional amendments can be determined later."

BMI is just a metric, one of many used to try and understand health. ""Abolishing it"" would be ridiculous, even from a social justice sense. It's still somewhat useful, just not as THE ultimate metric for health, but no serious doctor has ever viewed it that way in the first place.

Like,  we truly can't. It doesn't matter how anyone feels about that.  It's quite literally impossible to enact such a mandate within our system of government."

12/8/2021 9:26,"The ""Health delineation of being overweight based on it's negative health externalities"" is not, nor ever likely to be seen, in the mainstream, as a social construct, nor do I have any reason or evidence to believe otherwise and I challenge anyone to bring up real examples in society which would give evidence that said concept is headed in that direction.

There are many people who fundamentally misunderstand what social constructs are, and how they relate to what we can and should re-construct to better our society, but unless you believe all of academia is getting dumber, like Idiocracy, which is fun to meme but without any real evidence, then there is no risk of the concepts of social constructs destabilizing the building blocks of modern accepted knowledge, medicine, and facts.

The only people who tend to sincerely believe such tend to be ""race realists"", ""homophobes"", ""misogynists"", ""transphobes"" and the like."
12/8/2021 9:25,"Vulnerable people are still getting very sick and some are dying.

Every Covid case also presents the risk of a new variant spinning off. 

Children under five are still unable to be vaccinated and very young kids (a year and under, especially under six months) are at high risk. 

Even vaccinated people can develop long Covid, with debilitating symptoms that may never go away. Even asymptomatic cases can exhibit subclinical organ damage."

They insist that being fully vaccinated makes them invulnerable (um, maybe follow the science on that one?)

I’ve literally been told “well, too bad” I’m medical vulnerable, that it’s probably my own fault, and that I can’t expect others to restrict their lives just because some people will die. And these are people who self-identify as *progressive*."
12/8/2021 9:17,"It's not simply that some Americans feel that way,  it's simply the reality. Our federal government doesn't hold this power.

12/8/2021 9:16,"I'm in Florida in the US. Maybe that helps you understand my disappointment with how things have progressed lol

12/8/2021 9:13,"You've got it flipped. The numbers mean nothing, the % increase is what we *actually* care about. 

While everyone wishes those in SA well, the concern isn't for those 60 people, it's applying a 600% increase in hospitalizations to places like Texas and Florida, which were just about at their breaking point from the much less contagious Delta variant.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21128855/

You seem to be an american, but most people are not. And we dont really give too many fucks about CDC catering to the lesser educated part of the US pooulace. Vaccinations has worked like this for many years and some vaccines require 5 shots. 

Its also clear you never worked in a large organization since I still feel your notion of people sitting in a dark room conspiring, all those elite doctors and scientists. 

Ive worked at large organisations and even had a bit of contact with our national Public Health Agency. Im not inpressed. Do you think governmental institutions are much more effective than private entities? I would really like an answer to that."
12/8/2021 9:11,We have a pandemic virus going around that is known to negatively impact heart health. We also have vaccines that can cause heart inflammation. Can someone explain why they're ignoring these obvious potential causes and blaming it all on stress? It doesn't make sense.
12/8/2021 9:10,"Sorry, guess I should have been more clear. I am not in the UK, but I watched their 1st vaccination with great interest last year and thought it would be the beginning of starting to get things under control all around the world."
12/8/2021 9:10,"> The federal government will not fund any lockdowns.

And never forget that they absolutely COULD do this. They simply choose not to.

They could fund every American household with a monthly basic income for the rest of their natural lives, and yet choose not to do this so Jeff Bezos can not pay his fair share in taxes."

12/8/2021 9:08,Actually in western cities and Warsaw there are lots of young people who are pretty progressive.

This is probably due to prior immunity from vaccination/infection rather than the virus evolving to become less virulent."

12/8/2021 8:58,"Thank you for this perspective.  I’ve been arguing with my anti-vaccine mother and she is anecdotally telling me all the reactions to the vaccine that she has heard about, specifically myocarditis.  I responded that there is a higher chance of having an adverse reaction from getting infected than from the vaccine and she started trying to tell me that is not true.  

There was study done, and published in August in the New England Journal of Medicine, by Israeli scientists that compared vaccines vs infections for a whole bunch of adverse effects and it was clearly in vaccines favor.  

This perspective of having an adverse effect and then comparing the severity of that to vaccine vs infection is eye opening in its own right.  The pulmonary stress coupled with any cardiac issues would be on a whole other level of being sick.  I’m sorry to hear about your reaction, but that really could be the silver lining of this situation."

J&J's full series made a ton more CD8+ T-Cells compared to both of the mRNA doses. (Figure 1.e).

J&J is not as good against death compared to Pfizer/Modera, so neutralizing antibodies have to play a role at preventing severe illness and death as that's the big one with what J&J lacked when compared to the mRNA vaccines."

Also, I was buying masks and planning for the pandemic before most people in the USA. I knew it was spread by air instead of by droplets.  When the US finally started doing lock downs, I knew the lock downs wouldn't be very effective because the COVID-19 was already everywhere.

In the next cycle, I think in the USA most lock downs will be voluntary and people will be opting out. Many children may be missing school because the USA doesn't seem to be paying enough attention to what is going on in South Africa with omicron and the hospitals. When omicron is in every US city, lock downs and school closures won't do much good."

12/8/2021 8:25,"I appreciate the contribution, but that model may be too oversimplified to helpfully compare transmissibility and lethality at this point.

One issue is that it implicitly assumes an unlimited vulnerable population, so that exponentially more people overall become infected if transmissibility increases.  But if Delta is already so transmissible that the vast majority of people will at some point be infected with it, as many experts believe, then Omicron being more transmissible wouldn't change that or materially increase the overall number of persons infected.  The infections might happen more rapidly, which could be its own problem, but that's a separate issue.

Another problem is that for, reasons we don't fully understand, SARS-CoV-2 seems to spread exponentially only to a point, then taper off for a while before spread begins to increase again.  There is some evidence that more transmissible variants can lead to higher peaks with more overall infections (e.g., in some regions Delta peaked higher than prior, less transmissible variants).  But that data is noisy, with other areas showing comparable or lower Delta peaks, so we can't automatically assume an even more transmissible variant would have higher peaks versus merely steeper peaks.  Further, even where Delta did have higher peaks, they were not exponentially higher than previous variants, as a straightforward calculation applying its transmissibility advantage would have suggested.  So it seems a bit inconsistent with existing data to suggest that, if Omicron is more transmissible, it will result in an exponentially higher number of total infections.  I don't take you to have been necessarily suggesting that, but the model you linked implies that conclusion.

Tl/dr: The assumption underlying the model is that exponentially more people overall become infected if the virus is more transmissible, but that assumption is not necessarily true, and, indeed, it doesn't seem consistent with the data we have on SARS-CoV-2 so far."

12/8/2021 8:22,Uhm I have a hard time matching what you say with any facts or anecdotes I am aware of. Can you provide just one instance in which a person is called selfish for working in an essential profession?
12/8/2021 8:22,"Math time! 

Tldr numbers are made up because I am too lazy to look up the actual r values. However;

Let’s say Delta infects 30 of every 100 people exposed and hospitalizes 3 out of 10 of those infected. Now let’s say that Omicron infects 50 out of every 100 people exposed and hospitalizes 2 out 10 of those infected. 

In the above example Omicron would spread faster  with Delta being less transmissible. However if you put 1000 people in a room and gassed them Delta you would expect 300 sick and to see 90 hospitalized. With Omicron you’d expect to see 500 sick and 100 hospitalized.

Omicron is less “severe” but could still overburden hospitals with sheer spread."

It seems China knows how to handle it. They probably have a mandatory 14-day isolation and testing for all people entering the country. Their death rates are very minimal. They hardly have any lock downs. I think they opened their economy after only about 3 months.

The USA and most other countries are still dealing with wide spread lock downs and people afraid to travel, work, dine out, shop or go to school.

12/8/2021 7:52,"One ""experts"" opinion and yeah I'm aware that others agree with her.  Other scientists and Doctors also disagree.  When you have a vaccine that still allows replication and transmission of a virus (granted it does slow/reduce) that also puts pressure on the virus to mutate in a direction to avoid antibodies.  **We're already seeing it now with Omicron, fully vaccinated and boosted people being infected with the new variant.  Why do you think that is?**  Perhaps a mutation that allowed the virus to escape potential host's immunity was advantageous for the virus?  Of course it was.  Same way the flu and common cold viruses have been evolving for years.  We gain immunity, they figure out ways around it.

This is exactly what I'm talking about with fundamental dishonest in over-selling the vaccine.  Yes the vaccine is very helpful.  Yes it's saved many lives.  No its not going to stop the pandemic.  No it's not a cure all.  No it's not nearly as good as you pretend that it is."

If we had mandatory 14-day isolation and testing for all people entering the country, it would be difficult for very few people yet there would be very few omicron cases in the country.  If there are some outbreaks, they would be fewer and not in every state and every city.  We'd have more time to get people vaccinated.

Since the omicron variant is now being allowed to spread to nearly every country, state and city, by time the hospitals are overwhelmed again, they may force lock downs when it's too late for lock downs to do any good. Nearly everyone in the country will experience hardship again. Even if no lock downs are forced on people, many people will still be afraid to travel and afraid to work. In the long term, China will do better with this than the USA and most other countries."

12/8/2021 7:45,Let's build a wall
12/8/2021 7:44,"Yes. Stories like this (and this is the ..4th? 5th?) make me frustrated with how this is covered in the media, and also here on reddit. It's playing right into the anti-vax crowd propaganda, and making people wrongly believe the vaccines don't work. 

This is the 4th or 5th (The one in denmark, the one in norway, the nursing home ) recent event where a fully vaxxed crowd (and in this case, fully boosted crowd) had someone with COVID attend and a ludicrously high number of people in attendance caught covid from it - 40%, 50%, 70% or higher. Since not every one in attendance will have been exposed, it's an even higher proportion of exposed people who caught it. I think these stories will only crop up more often as winter drags on, peoples immune systems get worn down, and more crowded festive indoor events are held (christmas and new years, for example)

It is going to be totally impossible to try to claim the vaccine is highly effective at preventing transmission in the face of high profile examples to the contrary like this. It's not highly effective at preventing transmission (that would be the case if they had a party of 150 people, and ONE person caught covid, so R0 = 1, as opposed to R0=50). But that is FINE. The vaccine isn't some sort of magical talisman that either totally protects your or does nothing. It is meant to keep you from developing a severe illness or death from COVID. And it is STILL ROCK SOLID at that. Months later and two variants later! I don't think we have a single confirmed death from omicron in a vaccinated individual. 

As a side note, the media also needs to stop talking about 'fully vaccinated' and start talking about 'fully boosted'. Enough time has passed that the protection from infection in the vaccines has largely waned. The protection from severe illness still seems to be very good. I think the 'fully vaccinated' phrase is more of a red herring. The media \*also\* needs to stop trumpeting about the high case counts. Who cares? We aren't getting to zero covid. The vaccines are doing their job, which is protecting against severe illness and death. They aren't about driving cases to zero or stopping transmission entirely and I'd argue they never were. 

I feel like every time I post that despite these high profile mass breakthrough incidents, the vaccines are still highly effective at their original purpose, I get hit with mass downvotes from the idiot anti-vax brigade, but I don't care. 

It's time to get the media to stop talking about case count, and stop acting like the vaccine is supposed to significantly reduce transmission and so is not doing it's job when you have huge proportions of people at a party like this suffer breakthrough infections. Did any of them go to the hospital? Did any of them die? It sounds like no and no."

The 40x decrease would have put double vaxxed people at appreciable amount of risk I think-- especially since it looks like 3 of their 6 double vaxxed non-infected people showed almost zero neutralization.  

7x is so little as to be unbelievable though. With how much faster Omicron is spreading, it either has to have substantially more immune evasion or substantially more intrinsic transmissibility.  7x would be putting it above a R0 of 15 likely, which doesn't feel super realistic 

Might be somewhere in the middle of the two"
12/8/2021 7:22,"Yes I’ve seen this too, about the single-dose. I know they do it in some European countries already. US authorities seem weirdly evasive about natural immunity (even though the science is strong) but I guess that’s a necessity of public messaging. “Everyone get the vax” is an easier message than adding qualifiers.

The autoimmune factor is a pickle. There is a concern about giving vax to someone already experiencing post-viral autoimmunity. It could exasperate, or it could help, or it could do nothing. I’m not sure anyone is even studying this yet, since potential autoantibodies have only recently been discovered (like TSHDS and FGFR3)."

Again I'm vaccinated and thought it was the right decision for me based on the science.  I know multiple conservatives that are not vaccinated simply for the reason that they don't trust the messenger and the over the top exaggerations (if not outright lies) of the messenger.

So I actually have excess resources to devote to the care and well-being of others, be it my neighbors, friends, or people in other countries who don’t have access to vaccines and will therefore be prime breeding ground for new variants.

If that's the case, once the dominant strain of covid becomes less deadly, is it really likely for it to take a U-turn and go back the other way once again?"

The treatments are already here and the pharma companies know they're sitting on a goldmine whether they make vaccines or antivirals. COVID is here to stay.

This whole kickback against mandates is stupid. It's a stupid hill to (literally) die on. If people want to express their independence, do it some other way - don't put me and my family at risk.

The mandates are working, it's just the headlines that are skewing in the opposite direction.

If we get a milder variant that spreads well, but is more easily tolerated and provides protection  from similar strains, it will in effect be a means to 'vaccinate' a reluctant part of the population, similarly to how cowpox provided protection against smallpox. If Omicron is the fluffy bunny version of Sars-CoV-2, the immune systems of most healthy people will wipe it out before it can develop multiple mutations and escape into the wild."

>That just isn’t true.  False negatives are rare because the PCR tests are so sensitive and if we had a protocol of two negative tests, two days apart it’s assured that virus isn’t present.

Yes, the question about vaccinated individuals and quarantine should be revisited, but the article you posted literally says research into this is ongoing:

>Right now, only asymptomatic cases qualify, and students can’t take their first in-isolation test until day three. If that’s negative, they test again on day five. (If that third-day test is positive, but the fifth-day test is negative, they get another chance to test on day seven.) In this way, there’s a built-in insurance policy: A pair of negatives, separated by two days, helps confirm that a low-level infection isn’t being missed.
The program doesn’t yet have results to share: In the couple of months since Cornell began the pilot, fewer than 25 students have enrolled, according to Gary Koretzky, Vice Provost for Academic Integration at Cornell University.

When Texas had what little bit of a ""lockdown"" that the governor ordered in 2020, many leaders of individual counties within the state decreed that they would not enforce any of it inside their county limits, residents could consider it all voluntary. So, people were going from heavily populated urban counties with strictly enforced prevention measures, to more suburban and rural counties where measures were completely voluntary to shop, dine, drink, attend weddings and other private events, attend festivals and concerts, then return to their home counties afterwards. Even people crossing county lines for essential jobs contributed to spread."

It would get worse if I sit or lie down a certain way.

Back then myocarditis wasn’t a widely reported thing, so I didn’t even know what to make of it.  The pain persisted for two months; at some point the issue started to get reported on the media, even tho all the reports were adamant it was a young male issue.  At that point I started to suspect that it is what I have, and was really worried about getting permanent heart damage after letting it go on for so long.  So I started looking for basic treatment - myocarditis is essentially inflammation, so I tried taking Advil daily (ibuprofen being an anti inflammation med).  Couple of weeks later, the pain was gone and has not returned since.

Given that mine was a light case, I certainly didn’t regret taking the vax.  I just wish there’s more official support and guidance - I repeatedly complained about the chest pain on CDC’s vsafe check-in website, and never received any feedback, which was disappointing - you’d think since this is such a rare condition, it shouldn’t be a problem for them to reach out to us individually!

What’s also disappointing is that the medical authorities/professionals kept on repeating “it’s a tiny risk”, which while true, is completely unhelpful to those of us who already won the “tiny risk” lottery.  I would really want to know if I were to get a booster, whether I’ll be at elevated risk of getting more (or more severe) myocarditis, or if it’s completely random/not influenced by prior bouts.  But alas, I searched high and low, and there was no answer to be found.

Until there’s more clarity, I too am holding off on taking the booster.   I will be happy to do my part with the booster, but only if the government/medical authorities do their part to alleviate my concerns first.  The “it’s a tiny risk” refrain doesn’t cut it for those of us who already rolled the dice and lost!"
12/8/2021 6:25,"Polio was awful enough and common enough to preclude the anti-vaxxer response we're seeing now.

Covid19 is in this weirdly optimal spot (for the virus... not for us) of being highly contagious, and minimally lethal while still lethal enough, that it can and has infected and killed and enormous number of people. If the lethality was closer to 5% instead you'd be seeing people far more willing to do what they need to do."
12/8/2021 6:25,"When they say the vaccine offers ""1/40th the potency"", and with Delta already necessitating a booster shot for most adults, it seems to me that the original 2-shot regimen will be almost useless against Omicron. That's an important distinction, and if true, could go a long way in convincing the stubborn people in my life to get vaccinated or their boosters."
12/8/2021 6:25,"I hit bottom about 3 months ago, horrible crying jags, suicidal, but the worst was actually watching myself lose my sanity - it was slipping away, I was fragmenting... It scared me so bad that I saw my doctor and she changed my depression meds. I also got signed up for counseling. I'm doing so much better now, it's amazing. My point is, please don't resign yourself to staying in that numb state. You owe it to yourself to fight your way through any obstacles to your happiness. I hope that's possible for you."
12/8/2021 6:25,"In all seriousness actually 18+ are higher vaccinated than some of the younger populations. 12-17 and 5-11 may be lagging behind either due to lazy parents or especially in the case of 5-11 it just opened up recently. If you look at the [stats by state and age group](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-19-vaccine-doses.html#by-state), there's a lot of states where 12-17 is a full 10% or more behind 18+"
12/8/2021 6:25,This didn’t get nearly enough upvotes
12/8/2021 6:25,"From your link it mentions the following
>	This vaccine rollout data is reported by the number of doses of coronavirus vaccines administered, not the number of people who have been vaccinated.

So total administered is incorrect in this case as Denmark started administering 3rd doses and are counted incorrectly, there is still roughly 20% of the population that don’t have a single dose as per Our World in Data:

12/8/2021 6:24,"The wave of Omicron has just started. Patients are rising every day. I think It would be difficult to conclude anything right now.

Britain is also shivering due to sudden jump in cases.
BRITAIN’s health minister has said that there is now [community transmission](https://www.easterneye.biz/javid-confirms-community-transmission-of-omicron-variant-in-england/) of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus across regions of England but it is too early to say if this will “knock us off our road to recovery”."

12/8/2021 6:22,"There's that but there's also a number of records that get botched. For instance my first shot didn't get recorded and I had to bug the CDPH multiple times to get my digital vaccine card fixed. My physical card might have been accurate and most people would be fine with that but because the shot never went into the system I was likely one of those people in the stats who got 1 shot but not my 2nd.

I don't expect most average people will spend as much effort as I did to get the record fixed."
12/8/2021 6:22,"If it ever gets depoliticized it's possible.

MMR vaccine is 90-95% across most US states, because it's basically just a default vaccine for babies/toddlers. If a covid vaccine reached that status we could reach that level of vaccination fairly easily.

The big problem is the required condition at the beginning combined with the expansions of vaccine exemptions being created by the anti-vaxxers now."
12/8/2021 6:22,Your comment just made it click for me... I was under the impression that this means it's less severe...
12/8/2021 6:21,"Isn't that the receptor the viral spike protein binds to in order to gain entrance into cells? 

We've designed the vaccine to target these spike proteins. If the spike protein mutates too much the virus can't bind to the ACE2 receptor.

As long as it still needs ACE2, antibodies should still be able to detect the virus. That's my takeaway anyway."

But even if I look at posts here I see a lot of ""Reddit bias"" in that I see articles [overhyping vaccine effectiveness](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/r6ejmd/covid19_most_omicron_cases_are_mild_and_theres_no/) because we like vaccines and hate anti-vaxxers, but then we love to also hype up [doomsday anecdotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/rawyzz/nearly_70_icu_medics_at_spanish_hospital_covid19/).

12/8/2021 6:07,"Fair. And there is the potentially optimistic picture that if vax. protects from hospitalization then encountering the variant may also create that robust hybrid immunity (vax. -> inf. should theoretically be just as good as inf. -> vax. right?) Of course the answer remains we just need more data.

I do wish there was a way to accurately measure “natural immunity” so that people could personalize their healthcare. Off-topic but many post-infection patients are on the fence about vax. because of the unknowns of autoimmune PASC (inflaming an already inflamed system with the same S1 antigen). We don’t yet know enough about either the pathology of long-haul or how vax. affects it, except for a couple surveys and fluffy anecdotal news pieces."

Covid brain is a real effect, I couldn’t even remember the name of beef stroganoff I had to describe it with noodles mushrooms and beef.

MANY PEOPLE REGARDLESS OF VACCINATION STATUS ARE AGAINST VACCINE MANDATES AND BELIEVE PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE TO CHOOSE TO DO WHAT THEY WANT WITH THEIR BODY.  

In terms of the other stuff, you mentioned, there are people who are against required school vaccinations.  Anti vaxxers existed way before Covid and are against the required school vaccinations. 

Driver safety, what controversy are you talking about?  Controversy over putting a strap over your body (seat belt) to protect yourself?  Drunk driving laws?

Food safety is completely different than a vaccine and I find it hard to believe you would think those are similar.  Never heard anyone against food safety recommendations or measures.  

In terms of where are all those people, um hello we have a pandemic going on."

12/8/2021 5:57,"Some focused points from this article:

>The virus is using the same door into our cells (called ACE2 receptors) as before. This is very good news because it means our tools (like vaccines) are still useful. If the virus found a different door, this may not have been the case.

-

>we’re going to see an increase in breakthrough cases, especially among those with 2 vaccines. But this study gives me great hope that our boosters will help protect against Omicron. In addition, and importantly, neutralizing antibodies are not our only defense. We have other antibodies, B-cell factories, and T-cells (I explained them here) that will also help protect against severe disease and death. It will take time and more data to determine if we need an Omicron-specific booster.

-

>We’re starting to get data from the UK and it’s really not looking good. On Dec. 2, 2% of their PCR swabs were positive for Omicron. This is compared to less than 0.01% positive PCRs on Nov 20. Mathematical models estimated an R(t) of 3.47 in the UK right now. This is likely an overestimation, but even the best case scenario (i.e. lower bound) of the R(t) is concerning at 2.75. This tells us that high levels of Delta and/or immunity are not stopping Omicron in the UK. And it probably won’t stop Omicron in the United States either. We need to continue to watch this, but this is not a great start at all.

-

>Among a sample of 42 COVID patients in the hospital on Dec. 2, most were hospitalized “with COVID19” not “for COVID19.” Among the 42 patients, 9 (21%) had a diagnosis of COVID19 pneumonia. Among the 9 pneumonia patients, 8 were unvaccinated and 1 was a child. There were 4 patients in high care and 1 in the ICU.
This is a very important on-the-ground perspective. But it is still a very small piece of the puzzle. It is far too early to conclude that Omicron is mild; there are a variety of factors tangled up with each other"

I was amazed to discover in the placebo group they reported side effects in about 20-30% of cases. I knew about placebo effect, but to find out it was a quarter to a third was surprising.  

That is the hard data on the power of the mind to talk itself into something.

I was still a bit nervous when I went for my first shot but I remembered the placebo effect, and I used it to my advantage to talk myself out of the unjustified fear. 

No side effects for both shots apart from a sore arm and slight reaction at the injection site a week later.

I’m optimistic by nature but we probably have another year of this to go. Milder variants will (gradually) out-compete, new anti-virals will become widely available, and vaccine options will improve.

12/8/2021 5:35,"Boosters are normal after a long period of time such as 5-10 years if the vaccines created active immunity in the body. The diseases you mentioned have passive immunity instead of active. Rabies and tetanus are both immunized using passive immunity, which basically adds the antibodies into your body without activating your long term immune system. This means that the protection you have from these diseases lessens much quicker over time, usually around 1-5 years (still would be too fast for COVID vaccine.) The vaccines for COVID, Shingles, and Pertussis all cause active immunity in the body. This means it activates the memory cells to remember the markers for those diseases, creating immunity to the strands introduced for a minimum of 5 years if you are immunocompromised and if you are healthy it will last far longer. Boosters for passive diseases are used as precautions when exposed to a possible trigger. Boosters are given in these scenarios because your body does not match the intensity of active immunity. The active immunity granted by the vaccines produce their own antibodies and rely on memory cells, which stay in the body for decades. This is where my confusion is. The COVID vaccine creates active immunity, so why would anyone healthy need a booster so soon?"
12/8/2021 5:35,"> If you're vaccinated, unmasked, next to someone with covid, you'll probably catch it.

Omicron could very well be milder than alpha or delta, but even if it is half as deadly as either, the fact that it appears to be able to compete with the highly transmittable delta, and has the ability to bypass the immunity from previous COVID infections, appears to bypass vaccine immunity more easily than delta, and has the potential to backup and shut down health services still makes it a highly dangerous threat."

I just don’t see that happening. We have known since early in the pandemic that obesity is a big risk factor for Covid-19 hospitalization (and worse) and not one western leader said “Let’s all try to lose a few pounds to beat Covid-19”. 

We’ve ventured into decadence and we don’t say what needs to be said because we don’t want to hear it. And I’m not even talking about the fringe elements in academia who write articles for journals like fat studies and believe obesity is a social construct etc. (although that’s going to be mainstream in ten years, just watch). The simple fact is that weight is beyond the pale for almost everyone in the west; telling a teenage girl she’s fat, for example, is considered on par with physically assaulting her.

Such taboos are creating a slow-burning public health catastrophe."

12/8/2021 4:56,"Na mate. Transmission is exponential, virulence is linear.

Delta has an R0 (reproductive number of 5) 4x means an reproductive number of 20. So Delta infects 5 people the first day those 5 infect 25 the next day, those 25 infect 125. 

With an R0 of 20 it would be 20, 400, 8000. 

Assuming that 1% die for Delta and 0.5% for Omicron, Deaths would be 155 * 1% for delta so 1.55 people. For Omicron it'd be 8420 * 0.5%, so 421 people dead.

So yeah, that would be incredibly concerning, if those numbers were right.

Personally, acceptability is irrelevant to me because I don't think it's my place to judge other peoples' weight. Normal is.... a can of worms. Obesity pretty much *is* normal in America now. But healthy? No. 

People have the right to be obese. Their worth as humans is not diminished by obesity, and people should not be shamed or mocked for their size. But independently of all that, obesity is the single greatest public health menace facing this country. Everyone who is obese is being slowly killed by it, and our #1 public health goal post-COVID should be reducing obesity in Americans. 

Those last two points can just be hard to articulate in tandem, I think that really is the core of it. It's hard to have any kind of conversation at all about obesity, particularly online on a place like reddit, without some dipshit immediately dropping in and lobbing insults all over the place. In pushing back against that, I think some people miss the distinction and end up steamrolling valid and necessary points around public health."

12/8/2021 4:37,"I feel this. It became clear that there was a large segment of the population that, from the beginning, didn’t care if I died as someone who is more vulnerable. What has almost been more difficult is to watch people who were saying “we have to protect the vulnerable” at the beginning of this go back to their normal lives, as if there is no longer any pandemic at all, as soon as they themselves are protected, even though vulnerable people are still, in many ways, vulnerable. This probably sounds dramatic, but it honestly feels like a betrayal. Like it was never about protecting each other for most people, just about protecting themselves. I get that people are fatigued and over this, I definitely am. But completely throwing all precautions out the window doesn’t help and actually forces vulnerable people into even deeper isolation (or just places them at increased risk - I’m one of very few in my office building that wears a mask). Idk. I just want to live my life like everyone else wants to live theirs. I’m just venting at this point, but man I’ve lost faith in people."
12/8/2021 4:36,"Yes, but at some point the virus will have reached an optimum. With omicrons transmissibility seeming to be higher than Delta I doubt (as a complete layperson) that the room for potential mutation is really big.

There's also tradeoffs for the virus, e.g. maybe if it gets better at escaping the  immune system it may get worse at transmission. So I don't think we can roll up the Greek alphabet and go home, but I doubt the virus will get better and better (at transmission) for years to come."
12/8/2021 4:36,"So, I don't quite understand how states still get hospitalization records. With 55% vaccinated, that's not enough to keep things below all time high levels when far fewer were vaccinated? Are people just not being cautious? Is it Delta + cold weather?"

There's a reason people who get to the point of getting a Ph.D. and beyond trust science so much and it's not because we're brainwashed, it's because we're intimately familiar with the scientific process and how collaborative, iterative, and *grueling* it is. People on the outside don't really get to see or understand that process (And even if they did it takes a lot of training to really grasp), so I don't really blame them for all of their misunderstandings or misgivings.

> Beta variant escape from BNT162b2 in a live virus neutralization assay has been reported to be substantial (3) and our own data confirmed these results (4), with about 3-fold reduction in FRNT50. The results we present here with Omicron show much more extensive escape. However, escape was incomplete in participants with higher FRNT50 due to previous infection. Previous infection, followed by vaccination or booster is likely to increase the neutralization level and likely confer protection from severe disease in Omicron infection.     

The paper does a better job clarifying the question I was struggling with: Are those who are fully vaccinated at a greater risk for a breakout Omicron infection compared to those who are fully vaccinated with a prior infection and/or booster? Looks like the answer is yes."

12/8/2021 4:08,"This variant is unlikely to be drastically more deadly based on what we know right now- but we won’t have enough data to say for sure for a few more weeks. The fact that it isn’t obviously worse is a good sign though.

That being said, it could easily mutate further. Or a new mutation causes a new variant that is more deadly. Mutations are happening constantly, it’s just most are negligible. There’s a chance that there already has been mutations that caused covid to be more deadly, but said mutations didn’t compete with the dominant variant/never spread beyond the mutated source and fizzled out almost immediately so we never even knew it happened. 

Not that I disagree with you, just pointing out that saying future offsprings of the variant will be the same is kind of silly, since all variants are offsprings of the original virus. Every time the virus reproduces, there’s a chance it mutates."

I can imagine opponents also arguing against it for having a racial or ethnic element. For example, the idea that most Pacific Islanders would be overweight or obese might sit uneasily with people. However this only makes sense if you make a connection between morality and bodyfat—a very western fixation.

You encounter a lot of seemingly reasonable people on Reddit who are virulently opposed to it because some freakish outliers, like elite bodybuilders, might be considered overweight or obese on it. This reeks of reality-denial, frankly.

My own anecdotal experience with BMI is that I had slightly high blood pressure just from being a little “overweight” on the scale, and the day I got down to “normal” my blood pressure reading was healthy."

12/8/2021 4:03,"What good will assuming the worst do for the general population? As long as you continue following your government's recommendations, perform proper hand hygiene (and masking if recommended where you live), and continue to get vaccinated, there's nothing more you can do on an individual level. Governments, scientists and leaders can assume the worst as it helps them be proactive, but citizens can and should think positively and read optimistic news if it will help them mentally. Mental health is JUST as important as physical health. And if reading optimistic COVID news will help with your mental health, PLEASE by all means read as much as you can.

I never said don't think about COVID. In fact, I have said several times to make sure you're boostered (if eligible), continue to wash your hands, stay home when you're ill and mask up (if recommended in your area). But in reality, this virus will be with us forever. But we cannot live in isolation forever as that is absolutely a shitty way to live and can destroy us mentally. As long as you're vaccinated, it's completely acceptable to get back out there and live your life as long as you're taking some non-intrusive precautions. I'm going to a wedding this weekend with 100 people... my first one in 2 years!I disagree that long-COVID would be the worst thing for your mental health. Long-COVID, which is poorly understood and current research us subject to A LOT of recall bias, is uncommon. In vaccinated people, it's estimated to impact 5% of cases. Prolonged symptoms can and does happen after ANY infection. I once had a cold about 5 years ago and had a cough that lasted for months afterwards (young, healthy with no underlying conditions... was 22 years old at the time). The cough was so severe that I bruised ribs and it felt like knives stabbing me every time I took a breath. I would STILL rather have this compared to the severe anxiety that the bad news related to the pandemic is causing. Long-COVID impacts a minority of people. Being bombarded with only bad news and more and more restrictions will have a MUCH bigger impact on the public's mental health than Long-COVID."

With people mostly being idiots (according to you and I'm not disagreeing) this is how the government sold people on the idea that vaccines were an immunity and not just an immune system booster shot. I could give government the benefit of the doubt if it didn't take decades to change the wording. Doctors and scientists in general are very intelligent and I guarantee someone along the way (before the internet) said ""the definition of vaccine is wrong"". So, why didn't they make the change?

Because of interagency communication? Because they were poorly paid and just did not care? I doubt it. But I ask you again, why didn't they correct it before now? I know you can't give me a factual answer because I doubt you worked specifically for the cdc for the last 70 years and we're both just assuming what we think the government did. And that's ok. But quit denying the possibility that I'm correct and they didn't change it because the white lie was doing more good than harm and nobody was calling them on it until now.

Get your booster shot and move on with your life. If you’re that terrified then live a minimalist lifestyle"
12/8/2021 3:58,Cuba and China are above 80%.
12/8/2021 3:57,It is a way to detect it but how do you determine exactly the amount of spread?  I think it's just an indicator its present in that area.  Helpful to an extent but still not enough.
12/8/2021 3:57,"In my family we made a big deal out of our shots.  We didn’t know if anybody was going to have a particularly strong reaction, so when it was a family member’s turn we stocked up on some of their favorite treats and put on movies they liked and babied them, even if they felt just fine. Everybody got to take a turn of having a rest day and being pampered. 

Thankfully pretty much everybody in my family was just really tired, as far as reactions went. But I did get a big kick out of tucking my 75-year-old mother in and bringing her milk and cookies."
12/8/2021 3:57,"I had the same shots. All I felt was a sore arm for all rounds of vaccines. Slightly more sore for Moderna than Pfizer, but that could just be recency bias."
12/8/2021 3:57,"increase antibodies, but for the original variant of the virus"

12/11/2021 10:47,"Not surprising.  The vaccinated folks are convinced they are bulletproof, so they run around without a care... But the research that is coming out shows Omicron is quite the vaccine escape strain.  While vaccinated folks will have significant T-cell response and largely avoid severe disease, they're still likely to get sick.  Same shit we saw with Delta in vaccinated folks, but more of it -- Omicron's ability to escape antibodies generated from 1st generation vaccines is looking significantly higher than Delta.

Folks with comorbidities that align with increased chance of severe disease need to be very careful with this variant until we understand more about how virulent it actually is.  While mild disease is likely to be common in healthy vaccinated folks, that may not hold true for those with comorbidities, immune dysfunction/suppression, etc."

12/11/2021 10:45,">  Can people with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection receive a COVID-19 vaccine?

> Yes. CDC recommends COVID-19 vaccination for all people with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the timing of the vaccination depends on when a person had SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or when they received treatment.

> People with a prior infection: Offer vaccination regardless of history of prior symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, including to people with prolonged post-COVID-19 symptoms and people who experienced a breakthrough infection.

> People with a current infection: Defer vaccination of people with known current SARS-CoV-2 infection until the person has recovered from acute illness (if the person has symptoms) and until criteria have been met for them to discontinue isolation. This recommendation applies to any vaccine, including the first and second doses of COVID-19 vaccine. https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/hcp/faq.html

If you didnt receive monoclonal antibodies, where you should wait 90 days, you can get the vaccine now. The place you went was badly informed and i recommend trying somewhere else."
12/11/2021 10:44,"I wish I could ask you for some advice, but I already know what I need to know. Sadly, I need to move internationally and am going to have to get on planes. I have no idea what else I can do, and sadly, I don't know if delaying moving is going to be possible. (I'm already vaccinated and have had my booster shots, plus the flu shot, since I've heard that that might help a little.)"
12/11/2021 10:43,"What people are yapping about shouldn’t impact an objective measurement on whether a new strain is going to be problematic or not. Right now, barring new and conflicting data, it is looking like we aren’t going to be seeing a worse version of Delta. That’s good news."
12/11/2021 10:43,I read that covid is more contagious than the flu and colds. If that's the case doesn't that mean when you're sick it's more likely to be covid than the flu/cold?
12/11/2021 10:43,I had to delay my second Moderna shot two weeks because I got mine just before I was scheduled for the second shot. Now you can get the COVID shots with any other vaccine at the same time.

The best part is my parents recently purchased some properties in a new town. My parents are the type that find a local resturant and will go every morning for breakfast...every. single. Morning. They always make good friends with the staff, get them birthday cakes, christmas presents etc....the winner in the new town?

12/11/2021 10:17,"I’m less concerned about that and more concerned that they mentioned one person was hospitalized for two days but did not give details about disease severity or age or comorbidity.

Although it’s possible it’s due to medical privacy and it’s not the journalist’s fault. 

I know the CDC keeps aggregate data, and they can publish such data as an aggregate without violating privacy laws.  Does anyone know if such data has been published by CDC or elsewhere regarding the those who tested positive for omicron and needed to be hospitalized for it?"
12/11/2021 10:17,"Honest question, that being the case, why mandate vaccines for those who are low risk for sever infection (age-wis)?!"
12/11/2021 10:16,"Given what he's said in the past and how that's played out, I just take what he says with a grain of salt.

I think the best you can do at this point is pay attention to what he says and find empirical evidence to support what he's saying.

In the end, who knows. We'll find out one way or another.

If he doesn't know, he should say so. Whether or not he actually will is a different story.

If a densely populated country of 206 million can't distribute a million vaccines within 4 weeks (50k doses/day), the remaining vaccine shelf life is the least of their problems.

So what's your point? Of course you can still get covid when you're vaccinated. It's the bad, life-threatening version of it that you probably won't get, and that's the one you should be afraid of."

4. If he's between a) not test and not travel or b) test and maybe not travel, then why not just test?

12/11/2021 8:46,"I follow covid trends very closely and understand the look of the trends but that will mean virtually nothing over the next couple months in most of the US. Delta is thoroughly spreading in every nook and cranny.  Omicron may outcompete it but we are pretty far ahead of it and there are people yapping about omicron making this no worse than the cold who will be dead from it and or delta.  

It may be good news but it’s far from something to hang our hopes on at this point.  Covid will have its fill in the meantime."
12/11/2021 8:46,"The chart is interesting. In the last wave, hospitalization peaked one week after new cases peak. And deaths peaked one week after hospitalization peak. For omicron, new cases are now ~85% of the previous peak but hospitalization is only at 35% of peak but remember, it lags by a week. If you extend the blue line by a week, you’re probably looking at 45% of peak hospitalization in a week (for new cases at 85% of peak today). Importantly though, Tshwane’s largest public hospital group said “a majority of hospitalized cases are incidental” (ie for illness not related to Covid) and SA’s largest private hospital group (Netcare) said “up to 90%” of cases are incidental. If you assume more than half of Covid hospitalized in this wave are incidental, then the 45% is really closer to low-20% of peak.

TL;DR With new cases at 85% of prior peak, the number of people hospitalized for Covid is closer to 20-25% of peak after taking into account the lag in severe cases and non-Covid/incidental hospitalizations.

Edit: Omicron may be a lot more transmissible than delta (green line is noticeably steeper in the current wave) but it is about 1/4th as virulent."

They got sent home again for 14 days with the condition of ""unless you can provide negative tests"". They provided negative tests and doctors notes essentially saying ""these.boys are fine they're fakers"" and the school ended up refusing the boys reentry until the end of the 14 days.

12/11/2021 8:33,"This.

May of the symptoms people associate with Long COVID aren't even tested for because they're Psychosomatic and cannot be quantified accurately and can only be correlated with COVID infection.

Are you incredibly anxious since you had COVID? Yes? How much? Did your anxiety start while you were sick, or sometime after you recovered? How can we tell you have anxiety due to COVID infection rather than the effects of living in a pandemic that has personally affected you already.

Are you incredibly tired since having COVID? Same question about how much, and when did it start. How can we tell that your tiredness is a result of COVID vs. a sedentary lifestyle, lack of Vitamin D, or a host of other reasons.

Sure, some of those things we can test for. Yes COVID can have real side effects that last a long time. Every major respiratory virus can, and it's much more common than you think.

Also Long COVID means 20 different things. Some use it when talking about all effects, physiological and psychosomatic. Some use it to describe only physiological effects. Some use it to describe direct COVID symptoms lasting longer than X amount of days."

I’m pretty sure he’s wrong about that.

What would you recommend?

- Tell him that I’ve changed my mind and invite him to come anyway, accept some risk to save the relationship. The people who’d be coming are all boosted and the risk is small. OTOH they live much riskier lives than I (e.g., just back from Vegas) and it’s a 4 generation household that includes unvaccinated kids, one from a school that doesn’t protect very well. 

- Let it go and be relieved, but know that our relationship is damaged.

- Have a discussion about statistics that reassures him about the tests. He has no background in statistics.

And the last 3 months the majority of hospitalizations here were vaxxed here. Stats are doing weird things in small pockets and honestly its killing us. Literally.

There are also plenty of warning signs: brain mass decreases, IQ decreases, kidney damage biochemical markers, and others. These are all evident in mild or even initially asymptomatic cases. 

So yes, there are studies, and there are plenty of red flags to indicate that Covid should not be treated as a binary outcome of dead / not-dead. ""Mild"" infections in adults **and children** should also not be waived away."

These area all mild cases that do not need treatment or hospitalization but they have still come to the hospital. You can say mild cases don't include hospitalized patients (also not true as we have a lot of patients come on for something unrelated but we test all admits for covid an they are positive) but you absolutely can not say that anyone that comes to the hospital does not have a mild case.

I've been having symptoms for about three weeks? I left for a vacation three weeks ago, and at the time I started to get a sore throat. I'd wake up in the morning with it and a lot of phlegm, dismissed it as allergies. While on vacation, I started to get a really dry cough that got progressively worse, predominantly at night. Ended up seeing a Dr., dismissed it as allergies. Since I had then gotten medicine (cough syrup, allergy pills), my symptoms got better. When i got home, I still had a lingering cough, so I went to the doctor and got diagnosed with bronchitis, no covid test was taken. I was prescribed medicine, got a little better, but then my cough got a little worse again and I got congested. Went back to the doctor, got more meds, now I feel better. Still have a tiny cough, but it's going away day by day.

This just in, both my mother and sister got diagnosed with COVID today! My mom is urging I go get tested, which i'm fine with, but if I get tested and am positive, what's the deal with the isolation? I've been sick for weeks and am now almost asymptomatic, would I have to quarantine for the ten days? I've read stories where people test positive for COVID for weeks or even months after they initially got it, so it'd be silly to isolate if I had COVID this entire time and am finally better?

You can't really think that, at this point, with this in the wild and super infectious that mathematically we will have a big impact with vaccines, distribution will be too slow.

We can't stop this virus from proliferating, but we might be lucky that the rate of infection is high enough that it produces the best chance of global RESISTANCE via T cells, but not immunity.

The problem will be the rate of mutation or if Delta and similar variants do no share T cell/antibodies enough and you have more like 2 strains th so we might also get catastrophically unlucky, that's just how mutations work.

So.. yeah it's nice, but it's not going to help much with 7 billion people in the world and variants mutating this much and likely to increase with rate of infection."

At the end of August, half claimed they were basically fully confining themselves to their homes as much as possible, not sure what the numbers would look like now though: 

>However, the number who report social distancing has climbed slightly with half of Americans (50%) reporting that they are now staying home and avoiding others as much as possible.

[Also a supermajority of Americans claim to support social distancing to fight Omicron.](https://morningconsult.com/2021/11/30/covid-omicron-variant-polling-data/) I think these numbers are probably inflated by social desirability bias, but still.

I see too many friends packed into bars or restaurants acting like they haven't a care in the world.  I have had many of my vaccinated friends get Covid, some for the second time.  Get vaccinated, wear a mask in public, and consider staying away from crowds during this time.

I went to the physician and had me checked and he told me it wasn’t the kidneys any it would go away.

1.	Testing is far different in the US (home tests/sequencing are both far different/worse than UK) - and international travelers that are asymptomatic are being tested at a far higher rate than the general public here.

2.	 We’re not using the “same vaccines” - a huge amount of UK vaccines are AstraZeneca which isn’t used at all in the US.

3.	The dosing schedules are far different in both countries, with a far longer interval between initial 2 doses in the UK, as well as completely different roll outs in terms of age distribution - whether it’s initial vaccination or booster schedule.

I’m not saying that things won’t even out between the two countries quickly with how transmissible Omicron is, but at the moment that UK data does not at all negate the selection bias in Omicron detection in the US right now."

We're not there yet, I'd recommend starting with having a deprioritization of unvaxxed patients in hospitals if the capacity is full in favor of vaxxed patients (i.e. take off the ventilator of an unvaxxed person and give it to a vaxxed person who needs it if the person comes instead of our current first come first served approach).

But if that doesn't work, we may need to go as far as refusing them care outright even if there are beds available because that's how economics works. This does assume that vaccines reduce transmission significantly to a point where it's worth incentivizing to this point. Some of the data in even highly vaxxed countries don't seem to make it worth going that far."

12/11/2021 5:02,"You mean this study which, while underpowered to make any significant conclusions, undoubtedly supports that vaccinated people are on average less likely to transmit delta?

[https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S1473-3099%2821%2900648-4](https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S1473-3099%2821%2900648-4)

It's obvious that you do not have a good understanding of the burden that COVID has put on clinicians and patients of all diagnoses in the last two years. If you did, you would immediately see that some teenagers poorly founded objections to getting a needle in their arm are far outweighed by the societal good for ensuring that people that need urgently hospitalization are actually able to access it. The majority of the world recognizes this and there is unfortunately a poorly informed and very vocal minority that does not.But sure, continue to make gross exaggerations (.00001% of needing hospitalization? are you \*\*\*\*ing kidding me?) and making horrible analogies (manual transmissions?!) in order to tell yourself what you are saying makes sense.

The fact is that the vast majority of COVID deaths and hospitalizations, in all age groups and of all variants, are at this point preventable with vaccines. It is VERY clearly in society's best interest that the whole population is vaccinated. For a huge number of reasons ranging from obvious (making sure there are actually open beds in hospitals for people with non-preventable illnesses) to more subtle ones (i.e. fewer variants on average will arise from fewer infections)."

12/11/2021 4:53,"Two shots w. booster certainly doesn't fully protect, but the numbers do look better than just two shots where there seems to essentially none. Omicron in fully vaccinated w. booster: 8.9%. Percentage of the population that is fully vaccinated w. booster: 19.3% as of yesterday and it was 15.2% on 1 Dec (the data is reasonably complete up to 7 Dec, including the date itself, and it has been estimated that it takes a week from shot to effect, which also is what SSI generally has worked with in their reports). Additionally, a large proportion of those boosters have been in old people that often have a rather poor immune system, meaning that vaccines in general are less efficient in them. This probably skews the data compared to a situation where boosters already had been given more widely to the country's general population where it is likely to work better on average.

Regardless, how well fully vac. and fully vac.+booster work against serious disease and hospitalization remains to be seen, but I hope and suspect those numbers will be better."

12/11/2021 4:40,"> Does capitalizing THE change things

No, but adding 'of them' does change that. When you say something like ""I ate the most"" it is understood you are comparing the quantities that you and others have eaten. The total amount available is irrelevant. When you add 'of them' you are directly referencing the fries you mentioned previously. This means that your comparison word (most) is now referencing the fries, and the total quantity available is now relevant to the discussion. You said most of them were thrown into the bin, therefore your statement of ""This evening my wife made 50 French fries and I ate the most of them."" is deceptive and misleading at best since that statement specifically implies that you ate most of the fries, not that you ate the most of all eaters of the fries.

The correct verbiage for what you were implying/referencing would be ""This evening my wife made 50 French fries and I ate the most"". This would be analogous to saying ""pfizer has made 300bln doses of vaccine and the US has used the most""

The almost toxic levels of ignorance would have been bad enough if he had just been a man-on-the-street. However this individual was using his arrogance of ignorance to justify flying to a foreign country--that was already struggling to deal with the virus among its own people--so he could sit on their sunny beach front and drink himself unconscious.

I think about that story a lot. I often wonder what became of him--as a seriously overweight, older individual he was poised to experience the worst effects of the virus. What makes me far more reflective however is the thought of what became of all his victims he unknowingly infected, even if he pulled through while asymptomatic. Such... Wilful cruelty. Wilful stupidity.

Your other examples are nonsensical. Nobody needs to drive a car. Two gone. Not sure what you mean with jury duty. Where I come from you don't have such duties except if YOU WANT something or you messed up something. And the last one...how many killers are there in most societies?

12/11/2021 4:02,"At this point, it shouldn’t be a contrarian take whatsoever.

We asked/required our youth (as a very broad definition - this could go up to ages 50 or so) to sacrifice and have their lives blown apart to protect mostly the elderly and the sick. (Yes, there were some young healthy people that died of covid, but the percentages are incredibly small.) 

We sacrificed and are still sacrificing. But now we have incredible vaccines, knowledge, and treatment. I would say it’s time for these sacrifices to end. the vulnerable can take protection onto themselves with vaccines, boosters, masks, and distancing. Everyone can choose to continue these practices if they want.

But we need to stop limiting the lives of people that face no risk from covid, especially after vaccination. All schoolchildren can be vaccinated now, we need to get them out of masks at some point. Its just not good for human psyches to continue this endlessly."

The symptoms sound similar to a cold or allergies. So a lot of people probably don't get tested. I don't think it's a coincidence that pretty much everyone that's been found to have omicron is vaccinated. People that get vaccinated also tend to be people that get tested.

The source agency is right there in the title, the CDC. Furthermore they explicitly say the source is the ""The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"" in the body of that article. The source is explicitly stated, multiple times. The same source that has set precedent and released more information, specifically the city, of previous cases that were found.

(ii) omits any distinction between different risk profiles. This goes as far as not differentiating between efficacies of different age groups which are worlds apart. You must be reasonable for measures and risk cannot be minimized at all costs. Else you must ban sugar and alcohol, manual driving, even flying at some point because eventually, there will be another plane crash that could have been avoided. Flawed.

For a certain risk group, your argument might hold. But you cannot lock up teens because they have a 0.0001% chance of needing medical care vs a single digit percent chance for 80 year old people. If you were to pursue your argument, any vaccine must be mandatory. This pandemic will not and cannot be solved by boosting the whole earth's population every 4-6 months (which it should be for the significant benefits to remain)."

If their needs subsequently get met, there can be a reversal of their poor behavior. 

This means that “being an asshole,” often isn’t a personality as much as it is a response to a situation. 

It’s easy to say “fuck you!” to an asshole pulling out dangerously with great speed right in front of your car. But you have no idea whether that person is speeding because he just found out his wife is in the ER. 

When someone hurts us, we’re quick to label them an asshole, without knowing their story. When we do something hurtful to others, we usually say, “that was out of character for me because of the situation.”

and has checked every single positive PCR for S-gene dropout for a long time (now using an updated version of their qPCR, which reduces risk of confusion with very rare Delta's with S-gene dropout). In other words, it can be said with a reasonable level of confidence that up until they found their first Omicron, there had been none among the positive covid tests in the country and they also test alot. Unfortunately , that means that the percentages and rapid growth rate they have reported likely are real and not just an artifact of potential sequencing bias. Similar growth rates observed in the UK (with highest sequencing rate for a large country), too."

If he did make the universe then yes, it should and by that continuation everything should be predictable too to him and hence intentional. There's a saying in science that if you know the initial conditions to every atom in the universe and input in a computer powerful enough then you would have simulated the entire universe, every interaction, absolutely everything, there wouldn't be a single chance left to randomness left, unless you're saying humans are powerful than god, God should have this ability too.   


That's the thing, the covid virus, countless incurable genetic viruses, viruses aren't living creatures, they simply don't come under your free will or other arguments, they're not living organisms. And heck, I'll discount other less deadlier viruses if they strengthen our immunity, sure but those 2 categories serve no purpose in this universe other than cause suffering and death. None. I don't want a life without some sort of suffering, that would make all the good parts dull but these kinds of suffering are always life ruining, they benefit no one and never will.

So either prayers work and a god sends what people pray for (in which case did people pray for a worldwide pandemic?) or a passive god just created the universe and things happen however they happened.

Also frankly what you're saying is that the universe is not human-centric (which is accurate), which is contrary to what the Bible states. The Bible doesn't say anything about organisms, just humans and animals."

In the US at least, I also think they're concerned about follow-through from people who were vaccine hesitant in the first place, as most willing individual started the ""vaccination process"" a long time ago.  

They don't want them to get the first dose and then so many months later have regressed back to their old way of thinking.  Or even, ""I already got one of the shots.  Why bother with the second?""  etc"

Feel guilt if you neglect quality of the upbringing of your second child, but do not feel guilt for doing everything that you can given the circumstances.  

You do not control world events and pandemics.  Do not feel guilty for things outside your locus of control.  

These may sound like commands, but they're just suggestions.  Remember, we create our thoughts and thus our emotions.  If you beat yourself up over events outside of your control, you may be unwittingly teaching your child to do the same.

Should everything serve a purpose? 

>Incurable genetic diseases, pandemics like these, serves absolutely no purpose other than making all countless lives worse. 

Amoebae can cause dysentery, meningoencephalitis, and other diseases. To us those diseases are objectively bad. Perhaps amoebae are evil in some sense. But the amoeba doesn't know that. They exist to hunt and reproduce, just like us. Perhaps to the chicken, or the cow, or the lettuce plant, or the carrot we are evil monsters and ""serve no purpose other than suffering.""  (Or maybe that's what they would think if they could have complex thoughts.) From their perspective, they are probably right. 

We live in a natural world full of creatures which are competing with us - some of which want to use us for food, and some creatures large and small that often destroy us. We are competing too. We are the same as the amoeba, or the carrot, or the tiger, or the penguin, in many ways. The only difference between us and the animals is that we want to understand the universe. And also we aren't afraid of vaccuum cleaners.

>I fail to grasp how an all powerful being can intentionally do this and still be perceived as doing good

This sounds like a variation of ""How can God create a world where bad things can happen to people?""   

I think there are a lot of ""bad"" answers to that question. But here are some answers I find interesting, if not totally satisfying: 

1. Free Will.  The idea that life would be meaningless if life did not have the opportunity to make decisions for itself. If we weren't able to choose between right and wrong, we would be automatons. Would we be robots? Slaves? Just information? Can robots be alive? What would be the point of that existence? 
2. A life of free from suffering is not the point. We are here to experience and observe the natural universe as it is. We are here to observe struggle and to participate in it. We are here to make tough choices. Perhaps what is really ""good"" is the expression of love and empathy in a world where empathy requires sacrifice. Maybe we need to feel the suffering of others and to struggle to prevent harm in order that human existence can make some sense on a level beyond the superficial. Empathy is only possible when we can observe suffering, so suffering must exist. Could love and empathy be testable in a world where they were not needed? If you can't test it, does it exist?  You can ask the same question about the mystery of God.

I don't really know. All I can say is that I am okay with living in a dark and difficult universe full of suffering, so long as I can share my love and assistance with others, and so long as I can receive that love and assistance back."

12/13/2021 9:13,"In this case, South Africa is suffering greatly from the travel bans many countries have implemented as a result of Omicron.  The response from the ZA scientific community has been to aggressively message that the cases they have been seeing are mild, and some have explicitly stated they believe this should be a reason to relax travel restrictions.

It’s quite difficult to separate out scientific truth from lurking variables (like HIV status or age) and geopolitics in this case right now.  In a week or so, we will have much clearer data from the UK and Denmark, in populations that are much more demographically similar to most other western countries, and the question will be settled."

12/13/2021 9:05,Methinks the experts would've taken this into account when making statements about Omicron being mild.
12/13/2021 9:04,Downvoted for telling a story. Alright team. Should have said I was bedridden for a week like I was during the height of covid before boosters.
12/13/2021 9:03,Nope. We don't know this. Omicron infects through Delta. Doesn't mean your symptoms will be bad and maybe it could even help them but you definitely can still get omicron.
12/13/2021 9:03,"Just noting that this is the total number of infections and not the daily atm. 

However, in around 3-4 days this will be the daily rate. Omicron is incredibly effective."
12/13/2021 9:02,Masks does not work at weddings as there is food and drinks being served at the same time. This gives everyone a pretty long time to spread and contract the virus. I think the omicron variant is almost impossible to mitigate.

I’m involved in the wedding since it’s a family member, so it’s not something I can avoid and not go. Although I’m curious how social distancing will be handled, if any guests may not attend. I plan to wear my mask the entire time other than when eating. But I know family will peer pressure me to remove mask to take pictures or if I have to greet someone.

12/13/2021 9:00,"This is only in the context of the omicron variant, which has been known to spread among people who are vaccinated.  So it's still advised to do things like wear a mask and limit travel and contacts to only very important activities."
12/13/2021 9:00,Because they can't know with < 4 weeks of case data. It's quite a surprise that the initial effects do seem to be substantially milder -- are you sure you want to bet on there being no less favourable surprises in its longer term course?
12/13/2021 8:59,"Omicron is spreading like wildfire for sure, and I think it’s clear that in Denmark it is the most dominant variant already. The 20-29 age group is seeing huge numbers of omicron infections. My theory is that a large group of the positive people are getting tested because they are not vaccinated and need a QR code, so the infection is discovered  before symptoms occur, if they occur at all. 

Strangely in the age group 64+ there are very few omicron cases, so it’s clear that the variant has not  spread to this group yet. So while you seem to have enormous numbers of young people with very few symptoms, we still know very little on how the risk groups react to the virus."
12/13/2021 8:59,"That's the person I was attempting to quote, so thank you for the full text"
12/13/2021 8:58,"What part? That people won't take the vaccine? That is pretty evident at this point. 

And the other part had an if clause. Of course, if omicron does not grant you immunity vs delta then it's not going to end the pandemic, but if it does, it might just do."
12/13/2021 8:58,"But if the vaccine makes COVID mild, who cares? Are we really going to ask people to continue to postpone major life events, which have already been on hold for two years, over a mild illness? To me, it's more selfishness to ask people to go to such extreme lengths to protect those who refuse to help themselves (i.e. the unvaccinated). And, yes, asking people to postpone their weddings and graduations for three years is extreme."
12/13/2021 8:58,"I was living abroad until November and wasn't able to get vaccinated in my adopted country, so I've just now gotten my second Pfizer dose. Does this mean I'm basically screwed v.

The treatment really helped and I’m on the mend, but I hate to think what might have happened had I not had the treatment. I assume it would have been worse. Not sure if I’d need hospitalization but I can see how an older or less healthy person might. That cough was one of the strangest and scariest coughs I’ve had. I don’t ever want this again."
12/13/2021 8:55,"The german top Virologist Drosten says, that south africa isn't the best sample to assess the omicron situation, because they don't have a lot of people left, that haven't been infected or vaccinated yet. He thinks that it might be bad for the unvaccinated, becaus in South Africa more kids (not vaccinated) are getting more ill."
12/13/2021 8:54,"This will probably change as soon as there isn't shortage of booster shots, just like it did with the first 2 shots.

No point in a mandate when there isn't enough capacity to distribute it to all. But the moment vaccination numbers drop, a booster will probably be mandated."
12/13/2021 8:54,"One of the leading theories for the origin of omicron is that it mutated in a long-lived infection in an immuno-compromised individual.

This is a very good reason not to trust that it is mild after less than 4 weeks of case data. How sure are the South African medical professionals reporting mild illness that their patients have fully cleared the virus and are no longer in danger of future illness?

The long tail for fatalities and serious illness from the Spanish flu was many years -- google ""spanish flu parkinsons"" for details."

12/13/2021 8:54,"Fauci should read the story.  It seems he doesn't know that getting vaccinated alone isn't enough.

Edit: I don't know why so many down votes. It seems if vaccinated people wore a mask when shopping, or skipping a not so important activity would help prevent infections and save lives. Or do down voters believe that we should not make any effort to save lives of people who don't get vaccinated?  Still, many vaccinated and responsible people are at risk of harm done by hospital care not being available and economic harm done by lockdowns that could be imposed the next time hospitals become overwhelmed again."
12/13/2021 8:53,"Nah, a mild omicron would easily be better than any vaccine as long as once you have had it, you're good vs delta as well. 

The vaccines aren't that good in terms of ending the pandemic, so the chances of everyone taking them are slim to none. Most people would catch omicron if it is mild and we'll let it run free. It would be an amazing asset and exactly what we've been hoping for."
12/13/2021 8:50,"In addition to putting the hospital staff, doctors and nurses at risk, I've read that many hospitals are so overwhelmed, they've had to postpone all kinds of life-saving surgeries that people need, like cancer surgery, and other treatments, because they now need those wings of the hospitals for Covid patients. So, bearing all that in mind, here is my opinion: if you go to check into a hospital because you have Covid,  but you can't produce your vaccination card because you chose not to get vaccinated, you don't get in. You made a choice. You knew the risks, the vaccine is available free of charge, you can get it on any day, but you refused. Now you expect someone else who needs medical treatment or surgery to go without it because of you. My position is: Hell no."
12/13/2021 8:50,"We've seen some wild mutations. I know that ""seasonal"" makes it sound like the common cold and therefore as manageable... But just like influenza, cyclical waves of variant and mutations will bring about milder and more severe forms."

My home country of Norway have 90% of adults fully vaccinated, but have to reimpose restrictions as the healthcare occupancy is just growing and growing. It’s still at manageable levels, but it’s getting dangerously close to a point where hospitals only can take care of emergency situations. This will again mean more restrictions. 

And also we do not know what the omicron variant will bring."
12/13/2021 8:48,"Yes, previous exposure always gives cellular immunity that provides some level of protection from similar diseases.  In the UK breakthrough Delta infections have a 90% lower hospitalizion and death rate; they did use a 2-3 month dose interval that definitely does better than the 1-month interval used in the US and Israel. A third dose greatly increases that cellular immunity in addition to triggering more antibody production."

12/13/2021 8:46,"What's the hope here? It's good news that on an individual level, omicron is likely going to end up being milder. That means fewer medical interventions and fewer deaths. The big question mark that remains is will it be mild enough to avoid overwhelming hospitals."

Ask that question again in a month. We'll have a real answer by then."
12/13/2021 8:40,"I think they count only ""cases"" that are people who come into the hospital or maybe only the people who get tested.

Regarding the average severity of omicron infections for the whole population, that HOPEFULLY is very mild but isn't tested and isn't counted as a case because there are little or no symptoms in the typical person getting infected."

My fear in letting people have their premature ""its milder than delta"" is that it'll breed complacency.

Covid only started killing people in April of 2020. So it had only about 3/4ths of the year to rack up deaths. 

Second off winter surge deaths accounted for a ton of the 2021 deaths, and that began raging under Trump. Also some people who caught Covid under Trump would die weeks later under Biden. 

2020 vs 2021 is a flawed comparison for those and other reasons."

With something like the flu and covid coinfections, it can be more severe than infection with one or the other. tooold wanted to know if there could be a similar problem with someone getting infected with both Omicron and Delta viruses. If coinfection is likely and such led to much more severe outcomes, Delta going away could be important. From my limited knowledge, I don't think its likely the coinfections would happen and even if they did, it probably wouldn't lead to worse outcomes (compared to a similar initial viral load of just one version)."
12/13/2021 8:29,"Only if catching it prevents you from catching delta. 

Given that delta infection doesn't really prevent it, that's not a certain thing.

No vaccine is 100 % effective, but the ones we have are remarkably good at preventing severe illness and death.

12/13/2021 8:22,"OK, so think about this part:

> each time we get a glimmer of hope, cases start to surge again.

there are three major reasons this happens, in my opinion:

* the virus has both an incubation period and asymptomatic transmission, both of which make it easy for people to be spreading it while they think they aren't.
* people ""re-open"" over-eagerly every time cases go down, which leads to subsequent spikes even without new variants.
* vaccines are so unevenly distributed that most of the planet is still basically just a breeding ground for variants.

the first factor is absolutely containable with good vaccines, and the second factor matters less and less as vaccination expands, but the third factor undermines any and all vaccines.

we're basically encouraging the evolution of new variants and therefore threatening our own vaccines with obsolescence.

the type of equilibrium you're talking about makes sense as an ultimate outcome in my opinion too. but we either have to get everyone on the planet vaccinated, or dismantle the modern global economy and replace it with some more insular and separated model. neither of those things is going to happen overnight.

the Journal of the American Medical Association published reports of asymptomatic transmission in _February_ of 2020, almost two years ago now, and plenty of people still haven't even figured that much out. the epidemiologists and virologists were saying throughout the first year that the tests are for population characterization, not diagnosis, and everybody still formed their rules around the idea that the tests were for diagnosis. we've known it's airborne for a long time now and plenty of companies still put their COVID budget entirely into cleaning surfaces.

this is just not what it looks like when highly competent people have a problem fully under control."

12/13/2021 8:19,"I get what you are saying.  It is just hard for me to believe china’s model is the best.  China is way more dense than the U.S.. about the same size land wise but with the whole economy slammed onto one coast.  If they are the only country using this model it will be difficult.  Cause the rest of the world has just settled on letting people die.  Stopping work has huge economic bills attached.  I know letting hospitals go off the deep-end is expensive too.  China’s population is massive it’s hard to know how successful they really have been and there aren’t really any other countries that we can compare their success too with a similar strategy.  We are all going into winter together it will be interesting.

California 253.6/sq mile
Zhejiang 1600/sq mile

12/13/2021 8:17,"My guess is that if you get exposed to Covid so shortly after a vaccination you will at least have an advantage in fighting off the worst of it. Covid is one of those viruses that sort of crawls through your nose, hits your throat, kills your sense of taste and then hits the lungs. (I had it.)

The worse infections people had with pneumonia were where covid got thoroughly entrenched in the lungs and then the immune system kicked in with a panic. 

So my non-expert opinion is even six days in you will be better off that with no booster at all.

And when you feel sick as a dog the day after your booster you will be reassured that your system still remembers Covid."
12/13/2021 8:17,Sicker than Covid? Doubt it
12/13/2021 8:16,"It might.  We'll see.

If omicron kills puts half as many people in the hospital, but infects at double the rate, the exponential growth of cases will overwhelm us.

If it puts almost no one in the hospital, then we might be fine."
12/13/2021 8:15,"The vaccines alone are not enough. He should still advise people to limit travel to only most important activities, isolate and test just after traveling, and wear a mask in social situation even when you have been vaccinated. By time they let the omicron variant cause hospitals to be overwhelmed in every city and town in the USA, forcing lockdowns on everyone isn't going to do much good. His focus only on the vaccinations seems no different than Trump's operation warp speed."

12/13/2021 8:14,"That is true, although the scenes from hospitals in Northern Italy and New York from March last year show that wild type COVID-19 is not to be missed with.

12/13/2021 8:12,"Just to tag onto this the guidance in the UK is that you can now have your booster after 3 months instead of 6 months, they lowered the wait time."
12/13/2021 8:11,Surely this is the endgame.  The number of infections we're going to have over the next two months will give a tremendous level of population immunity.
12/13/2021 8:11,Great... I'm attending a wedding in 6 days. My first large gather in 2 years. Getting booster today. Hope it has some positive effect in around a week
12/13/2021 8:10,"I think the problem is that Omicron being less severe is outweighed by being more infectious. 

It all depends on how the data plays out. A smaller percentage of people needing hospitalization among a larger number of infected could overwhelm the health-care system. 

At this point we just don't have the data to make any firm predictions."

12/13/2021 8:01,"The lockdowns, especially for people who travel, only work very early in the outbreak. This keeps the outbreak limited to just a few towns and cities. As done in China, the lockdowns do little economic damage because it only effects a few cities and a very small percent of the huge population.

The problem in the US and most western countries is the population isn't willing to comply with harsh travel restrictions - international or local. So by time the pandemic spread to every town and city and hospitals are overwhelmed, lockdowns on the whole population don't do much good and do severe damage to the economy and maybe cause political instability.

In the middle and later part of the global pandemic, having strict 14-day isolation and testing of every person traveling into the country prevents new outbreaks within the country.  The government could help make it as easy as possible for travelers to do the isolation and testing because only a small percent of the total population travels into the country.  When there is a new outbreaks within the country, then nearly every person in town is tested and any of the very few people exposed are isolated for a few days. Because the number of towns with new outbreaks is so small, there are plenty of funds to help those isolate and get tested until it's safe to fully open the economy in the local area.  Most towns and cities don't have outbreaks, so there is no need to lockdown the whole country as long as you keep detecting and containing new outbreaks before they spread everywhere.

In the USA, it seems they still let it spread everywhere.  So it's best for individuals to plan for another major wave and possible lockdowns on the whole population when the hospitals become overwhelmed again.  That would be damaging to the economy but they never learn about the ounce of prevention being worth a pound of cure."

If its been six months since your second shot and you haven't received the booster your protection against getting the Delta variant is about 48% but you have a 10% chance of being hospitalized which is still cause for concern for me. Those numbers are for pfizer and account for all age groups but like I said my parents are in their late 60s and not in the greatest health.

Not really, this is a very American centric view. In countries with high vaccination rates like Isreal and UK are still struggling. In the UK the majority of deaths and hospitilisations are vaccinated people, a consequence of high vaccination rates. Yet the healthcare system is still under pressure. If Omicron isn't significantly less severe than other variants, even a 100% vaccinated country could still find their hospitals filling up, due to how transmissable it is and the fact that the vaccine isn't 100% effective."

It's more contagious than any variant we have seen before. We don't know if it's more contagious because of easier spreading or just because of immunity/vaccine evasion. It's probably a combination of both.

To explain of contagious it is we can take Denmark as an example.
All over the world we have a doubling rate in 2-3 days. 
Denmark had a total of 2500 cases yesterday. There is obviously a delay between infection and testing. Let's say that delay is 6 days. If Denmark continues with doubling every other day then there was a total of 20 000 Danish people infected yesterday. If this trend continues to Christmas there will be a total of 1 280 000 people infected (or previously infected) on Christmas.

Make it 4 more days and every single Dane have been infected."

First confirmed in a sample from 8 November in Gauteng (page #21) and it was already the dominant variant 8-14 November (page #14) in that province. There are samples from the [very beginning of November](https://www.news24.com/news24/southafrica/investigations/covid19/inside-sa-leg-of-omicron-variant-discovery-a-single-test-result-a-missing-gene-and-an-email-20211128) that most likely were Omicron, but weren't sequenced. The status in some other provinces is unclear because of insuffient data (e.g., most recent sequencing data for Limpopo is from early Oct., most recent from Free State from late Oct., no sequences from Mpumalanga 1-7 Nov. but two from 8-14 Nov. are both Omicron). It was likely already dominant in the capital region of Namibia [at least from mid-November](https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/science/namibia-detects-omicron-coronavirus-variant-18-19-samples-2021-12-06/), but sampling is too limited to say for certain. We know even less about several other countries in the region because of limited sequencing.

For a long time, European countries have sequenced at a [fairly high to very high rate](https://covidcg.org/?tab=global_sequencing) ([detailed overview](https://www.gisaid.org/index.php?id=208)), also much more than South Africa, which is a leader in their continent. For it to somehow still be overlooked for a longer period in Europe is extremely unlikely. On top of that, Denmark has for a long time [used a qPCR test](https://reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/rem4m9/on_11_dec_denmark_reports_8_omicron_on_7th/hobo2h2/) on all their COVID-19 cases and because of its mutations any Omicron is flagged, including the BA.2 subvariant. We can say with a high degree of certainty that there had been no Omicron's among their COVID-19 cases until late November.

Omicron is likely to become dominant in the first European countries very soon. That's a full month after it is first known to have happened in part of Africa and there are many countries in that continent with extremely little sequencing data (i.e., we just don't know about its status there)."

12/13/2021 7:36,"If you’re asking if you’re relatively safe against symptomatic infection from Omicron without a booster, then no. The best data I’ve seen so far is that 2 doses of Pfizer drops to 30% against Omicron infection, and 2 doses of AstraZeneca drops to 0% against infection.

In both cases, a booster of Pfizer restores it to 71-76% (still a 20% drop from the 95% against Delta provided by a booster).

For “severe disease” there’s not strong data yet either way, but the general consensus is that 2 doses should still provide good protection because T and B cell immunity should still be relatively robust. It will take more time to prove that via real world data though."

And, the new [omicron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2_Omicron_variant) cases are spreading very rapidly in many countries.

This all indicates that the next wave of the mild yet extremely contagious omicron variant will take place over a matter of weeks instead of months. It looks really bad but I hope people don't panic. It's not realistic for the our government for force major lockdowns on the whole population.  People should plan to limit travel and contacts with others for the next few months.

After about a year of isolation, we decided to start setting up play dates, travel, seeing family, eating at restaurants, going to stores, etc ... Basically retuning to as normal as possible while still wearing masks and being outside whenever possible.

Our pediatrician was extremely clear when he told us that isolating our kid would be significantly worse than most likely covid19 outcomes. Isolation would be 100% likely to cause issues, covid has less than <1% to cause issues. A pediatric ER doctor (that works with covid patients all day) told us the same thing. It was uncomfortable but I have to put my money where my mouth was and trust the science. And the science (both doctors in this case) were unanimous.

It's a bit nerve wracking but she's developed and grown so much in the last year, I can't imagine how much she would have missed out on if we had continued to isolate.

Talk to your pediatrician to see what the right call is.

CDC’s definition of VOC

[SARS-CoV-2 Variant Classifications and Definitions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/variant-classifications.html#anchor_1632154493691)

“Variant of Concern (VOC)
A variant for which there is evidence of an increase in transmissibility, more severe disease (for example, increased hospitalizations or deaths), significant reduction in neutralization by antibodies generated during previous infection or vaccination, reduced effectiveness of treatments or vaccines, or diagnostic detection failures.

Possible attributes of a variant of concern:

In addition to the possible attributes of a variant of interest

Evidence of impact on diagnostics, treatments, or vaccines
Widespread interference with diagnostic test targets
Evidence of substantially decreased susceptibility to one or more class of therapies
Evidence of significantly decreased neutralization by antibodies generated during previous infection or vaccination
Evidence of reduced vaccine-induced protection from severe disease
Evidence of increased transmissibility
Evidence of increased disease severity”"
12/13/2021 6:59,"Additional caution when we don’t know yet how dangerous it is can spur leaders to implement policies like mask mandates and vaccination requirements to slow the spread where they might not have otherwise done so. 

If it does turn out to be mild, then those restrictions can be lifted in the next few weeks and the worst effect might be that a few people missed some nights out at the bars. 

If it turn out that it’s not as mild as some are saying (i.e. as dangerous as other experts are saying is possible) and those precautions are not taken, it means tens of thousands dead and hospitals overrun. 

I don’t see any downside to being cautious and preparing for the worst now."

12/13/2021 6:57,"Unfortunately I agree that it's getting really bad. The mild-yet-very-contagious variant may cause the same in number of deaths, but the time period of the next 500,000 deaths in the USA maybe weeks instead of months. That means hospitals will be severely overwhelmed in late December and January, and then the pandemic will seem to suddenly stop in about February when the disease suddenly runs out of new hosts to infect.

I've found new information here at r Coronavirus and en.wikipedia that shows case numbers are still growing at an accelerated rate in South Africa.  [South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_South_Africa) reported 37,875 cases today, many more than usual because they didn't report some backlogged cases the past few days. Also, the excess deaths chart reported about once a week seems to be starting to increase December 4th even though the current 21 deaths per day data doesn't show as many as in the previous waves of the pandemic in South Africa. Regardless to what our government leaders say, we have to plan for another large wave in the pandemic.

It seems the health care leaders in the US don't want to do anything harsh until we see all the hospitals overwhelmed and hundreds of thousands of people dying from this new mild yet more contagious variant. I don't trust them - getting vaccinated really helps but it's not enough. I think what we should do is to advise for people not to travel unless it's extremely important.  Christmas celebrations should be kept small and be postponed to Easter. If you must travel, the person's traveling should plan to self isolate for 14 days and test before meeting with people.

What the government should do is at least is advise what people should do. They should make it easy to self-isolate, such as making it easy to buy MRE (meals ready to eat) and other basic food and groceries online. They should assure that good quality masks are available.  In the US and UK it seems unrealistic to try to use the laws for force people to comply. People should be informed that there won't be beds available in late December and January. Any elective health care will have to wait until at least February 2022. I'd guess what we will see is many temporary hospitals set up like they did in the [Spanish Flu in 1918](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu). Because people in the US and UK are not willing to comply like how the Chinese did to stop COVID-19, for us it's up to individuals to try to minimize the risk for themselves and a lot of other people in the US and UK are not going to do so well."

12/13/2021 6:54,That was a calculated (but probably misguided) attempt to save supply during the early days so we could protect medical staff. Having all the medical employees get Covid was far more dangerous at that point (also we were literally wiping our groceries so our understanding wasn’t exactly good)
12/13/2021 6:54,Chise the Moderna scientist held a chat last night in twitter....she said life goes on and it should not stop because of covid. What is important is you get your shot and booster and wear masks.

Very different from the exponential increase in central Europe. And Germany from my knowledge atleast was quite late in implementing the mandate , the damage had already been done, damage that could have been avoided if they acted proactively and had mandates in place in the early summer. And yea, the us also doesn't have vaccine passports so what's your point exactly?"
12/13/2021 6:52,Do you have a source for that? All I've seen is the opposite in that prevention of hospitalization and death is still strong with the full regiment of vaccine (non boosted)

Many parts of the USA are well vaccinated and heavily infected as well.

I live in a place that is 75% double vacced and is up there in terms of total cases per 100000, and total deaths per capita, so it really got hit hard in two waves. I've been waiting to see some evidence that this will put the breaks on things, but have seen nothing reassuring from the UK on this point, bar perhaps their hospitalization numbers.

For omicron though, hospitalizations are going to be directly linked to how many over 65s have boosters. The urgency of that has not been communicated."

But... (90-95% of the time) only the unvaccinated get very sick. And the fact that COVID can make you very sick is the reason we care so much about it in the first place. 

COVID is never ever going away. All we can do is make it a mild nuisance, like the majority of other respiratory diseases. If COVID manifests as the common cold, it's not a big deal. And vaccination makes that happen. Even in this very story. 

To the extent that COVID is a global health crisis, it's still because of the unvaccinated - those at risk to get very sick and overwhelm hospitals. It's not simply because it ""exists."" The fixation on cases is obsolete."

Duration of efficacy is literally the only thing that can't be assessed in an emergency use authorization. 

Like, if we wanted to wait four years and do fuck all, we might arrive upon a dosing and scheduling course for vaccination that took two years and four shots, off the bat. Instead we did this weird thing where because millions of people were dying, and safety was established, efficacy over time wasn't established.

That decision saves many hundreds of thousands of elderly people from dying."

>But as the celebration wore on, the cocktails came out and people took to the dance floor, many leaving their masks behind, said Debra Furr-Holden, an epidemiologist and associate dean of public health at Michigan State University, who was in attendance and believes she contracted the coronavirus there.  
>  
>Furr-Holden said the revelation that even this group of “risk-averse” and “super responsible people” could have let their guard down enough to become unwitting vectors of COVID-19 shows just how vulnerable even vaccinated people remain to the virus when indoors and in groups.

Some went to work before finding out they were infected, causing potential exposure of the virus to a total of 38 other employees and patients at two Oakland hospitals, health officials said.Six of 12 known cases among East Bay residents who attended the Wisconsin wedding are due to the omicron variant, according to the Alameda County Public Health Department.  
>  
>Wisconsin public health officials on Dec. 3 announced they were investigating the outbreak but had not yet found any local positive cases among wedding guests. Officials had no updated information about their investigation this week. They said one wedding guest had recently returned from an international trip.

>Masks are not required to be worn in public places indoors in Milwaukee, though the city’s public health department encourages it.  
>  
>Kaiser Permanente said 11 of its employees at Oakland Medical Center were infected, and they were all fully vaccinated and had received booster shots. The staffers potentially exposed eight patients plus another eight employees, leading to quarantines and shuffling staff assignments to cover shifts. As of Dec. 8, 13 of those exposed had tested negative.  
>  
>Kaiser wouldn’t provide any further details about the outbreak, such as the department involved or if any additional patients or employees tested positive. Kaiser officials said in a statement that the possible window of exposure was “brief and isolated.”  
>  
>“The few affected staff members, who are in patient-facing roles, worked briefly prior to being symptomatic or tested and all adhered to COVID-19 infection prevention guidance while in the facility,” according to the statement.  
>  
>At least one of the positive cases also worked at Highland Hospital, where officials have notified staff and begun contact-tracing efforts to ensure no others are infected. Victoria Balladares, director of communications for Highland’s parent organization, Alameda Health System, said that 11 other staff members and 11 patients were potentially exposed and none has so far tested positive for COVID-19.

She said she felt confident she could travel safely and was told most of the wedding attendees were vaccinated.

She provided a sample to a public health laboratory for variant analysis and is waiting for the results.

>Omicron has been detected in 25 states so far.  
>  
>After she got home from the wedding, Furr-Holden said she was already concerned about a scratchy throat when she received a Dec. 1 text message from the bride, a beloved former student of hers, that someone from the wedding had tested positive for COVID-19. Furr-Holden tested positive for the virus the next day.  
>  
>Furr-Holden said she must have infected her daughter, who has a 3-month-old baby and also tested positive for COVID-19. They spent a week in isolation away from the baby, a heartbreaking but essential measure of protection. The child was cared for by another family member and never developed symptoms.  
>  
>Furr-Holden said she and her daughter had mild symptoms including a sore throat, headache and fatigue when active.  
>  
>Thinking back on the wedding, Furr-Holden said she believes the presence of responsible, vaccinated guests provided a “false sense of security” at a time when the pandemic is exhausting yet not over. She said she kept her mask on apart from eating and drinking and left the reception early, but “that clearly wasn’t enough.”  
>  
>Furr-Holden commended the bride for quickly notifying guests and said she hoped it would provide caution for others making choices about how to safely socialize.“If I had to do it all over again, I would have sent a nice gift and a loving handwritten card,” Furr-Holden said. “We just shouldn’t be having these large events now.

12/13/2021 6:11,"Comparing based on active cases doesn’t make sense, because Omicron is more contagious and spreads quickly, while the 11-16 day lag between infection and ICU remains the same.  If you select ‘Gautang’ and look at the time series you can see the hospitalizations and ICU are just starting to climb up."

https://i.imgur.com/2bWy7Uw.png

I was also surprised that Beta did not go far.  It did really well in SA.  Perhaps its spread was limited by a combination of travel restrictions and the Alpha variant that was making the rounds far and wide in the same timeframe -- My understanding is the Alpha variant, while less virulent than Beta, was more transmissible, giving it a reproductive advantage.  That could have prevented Beta from taking hold outside SA, as Alpha quickly spread far and wide.  Alpha caught up with SA between their Beta and Delta waves, but apparently didn't have enough antigenic drift to induce a case wave like Delta did."

12/13/2021 6:05,"I think I should back up and make what I'm saying clear. 

What do I *think* will happen? I think that COVID wasn't, isn't, and will never be lethal enough to wipe out humanity. As a species, I'm sure there are millions, if not hundreds of millions of people with various mutations to their ACE2 receptor protein that render them immune to COVID, even without a vaccine. COVID isn't even all that deadly to begin with. It would take some pretty crazy mutations and a whole lot of luck for a descendant of SARS-CoV-2 to get the magic combination and become apocalyptic.

Has a virus ever wiped out a species? It's possible, but not that we know of. But viruses can do do regularly wipe out local populations. At the cellular level, bacteriophages will wipe out entire colonies no problem. In the sea, bacterioplankton get decimated repeatedly by virioplankton, doesn't regrow until a more resilient bacterioplankton comes along. It wouldn't be hard for an endangered species with low genetic diversity to get infected and go extinct. If you want an example of when a virus wiped out humans, I would point you at the black plague, and at what happened when European settlers landed at North America. This sort localized eradication is very real. The question is if enough of the species survives to reproduce, and that doesn't always come true. There are plenty of species that are at risk of extinction and under serious threat from viral infection. The Gros Michel went extinct because we couldn't cure it of a fungus, and it was all cloned from one cultivar. 

That said, if you had said that viruses always evolve to become milder and coexist with their host, you would be patently wrong. Smallpox didn't get milder. We eradicated it. Measles hasn't gotten milder. Bubonic plauge hasn't gotten milder, we just invented better medicine. Tuberculosis hasn't gotten milder. The list of diseases that never became as gentle as the common cold is literally the list you get vaccinated against as an infant and child. And Delta is an obvious counterexample.

It's actually quite rare for any infectious disease to evolve to become highly transmissible in a new species. Almost every time a disease has jumped species, it's been far worse on the new species than the old. The progenitors of HIV-1 and HIV-2 don't even cause disease in the chimpanzees and sooty mangabeys they came from. So HIV is worse and has not evolved to become milder. We have better drugs, but it hasn't had any reason to evolve to become milder, and so it hasn't.

SARS-CoV-1, ebola, and MERS all wound up being too lethal to spread effectively. This is, indeed, the most common outcome. 

But let's be clear. I haven't found enough data on any disease that kills as quickly as COVID, and is as transmissible despite having to jump species. I don't actually know which way a virus will mutate. Probabilistically, it will mutate in ways that kill itself. Lots of rapidly mutating viruses generate more inactive viral debris than they do live virus. Up until omicron, SARS-CoV-2 was mutating pretty slowly. But I find it ignorant and oversimplifying to claim that viruses must evolve to become milder, even if they last forever. And it's not even clear that SARS-CoV-2 will last forever. It's very unlikely that it will go away, but it's also not impossible that it could become so infectious that in the two weeks it takes to recover from infection, the vast majority of the world gets infected too, and we're all immune at around the same time. Or we might develop a working prophylactic that prevents infection, and disseminate it widely enough that the vulnerable populations stop evolving new variants. Heck, the pi/rho variant could be the deadliest variant yet, but also the first to lack the nasty asymptomatic and presymptomatic spread that made COVID so much worse than SARS and MERS. So many possibilities.

Okay, moving on to the ego stroking! It sounds like you just want to assert authority over me, which isn't a good use of my time. I've read lots about evolution and studied it at the molecular level, so you can stop suggesting I need to learn more as you quote lines that sound like they're straight out of an (outdated) high school textbook.

I have other things to do in my life than get mocked by three-sentence rebuttals that focus on sounding smart without contributing constructively towards common understanding, unfortunately. If you have questions about science I'd be happy to try to answer them. I've tried to be fair here and explain that I don't actually believe COVID will wipe us out, but it's not right to pretend that COVID won't become more virulent and deadly while it fails to drive humanity to extinction. If you want to talk science, I enjoy and welcome it. I won't bother responding to further mockery."

Let me be clear. Your life matters, and I’d hate to be in your shoes. You have every right to be worried about Covid, but most of the people here don’t really.

So 6 months after September, you should expect to get a booster shot. We don't have enough data right now for the omicron variant to say if you need to get the booster sooner than 6 months, so for now, go with 6 months.

Right now, with 2 shots, you're fairly well protected against severe illness/hospitalization/death, but less protected against infection from the new Omicron variant.

12/13/2021 5:29,"Even if it’s doubling at 2-3 days (unlikely in practice, especially given that likely early transmitters mare travelers that are more likely to be vaccinated and/or quarantine), if it came to the US in early/mid November we’re only 10 or so doubling periods into this. That would be a few thousand infections, with the majority of those occurring within the last few days.

Wastewater testing can pick up really small levels of virus (on the order of ~1 in 100,000 people), so even if a number of testing sites had it it doesn’t mean it’s necessarily super prevalent. If someone with Onicron pooped at the airport restaurant last month and also started a chain of infections that double every 2-3 days, that person would be responsible for maybe 1,000 infections right now and 750 of those infections would have occurred within the last week. 

That’s how exponential growth works. 1 case in November might mean 1,000 cases today, but tens of thousands of cases by the end of the month, and millions by February. Europe being just a week or two ahead of us could mean that they have many times more cases than we do."

The term I have repeatedly used, “allocation of resources,” is the public health term for “rationing care.”  This is not an abstract concept being discussed.   This is a deliberate decision making process based on key ethical principles, including the degree, likelihood duration and number of people that would benefit of a given treatment approach.

It is *always* done to save as many lives as possible.  There would be no point to allocating care if it wasn't in the interest of saving as many people as possible.  Lets say we have 100 units of a resource and 12 patients. The first 10 patients need 10 units of the resource to survive.  The other two each need 50 units of the resource to survive.   It is unethical to let 10 people die no matter how much more the other two are struggling.  Now it very well might be that those two struggling patients made choices that put them in their desperate state. However, the decision to allocate the resources to the other 10 isn't a judgement on their poor choices, nor is it a suggestion that they aren't *deserving* of care.  It is simply the ethical allocating of resources to do the greatest good for the greatest number."

Regen-Cov is approved and perfectly safe.  The others are awaiting EUAs and have safe results.

The US Government has spent over $10 billion on these treatments alone.

So while the US does lead the world in COVID-19 deaths, that is because the US is the third most populous countries on the planet and neither India nor Brazil have the resources to properly account for deaths.  India still hasn't controlled TB, let alone is able to accurately count those deaths.

Adjusted for population, which is the correct way to judge, Peru currently has the most deaths per capita.  The US is 19th again thanks to the large unvaccinated population by choice rife with comorbidities like diabetes and obesity.

But at the same time, you believe that the professional ethics are always engaged even outside of the professional context.   Therefore, in your worldview it is always ok for a random person to act unethically in the context of larger society, but you don’t afford the same to professionals.

So, **within the context of the time of care**, it is true that a physician must administer the same treatment to a patient regardless of who or what that patient is.  However, a physician is NOT obligated to even treat every patient who comes to them.   This is why they passed Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) back in 1986 to ensure that uninsured patients would still receive care at ERs.   In other words, in non-emergency room situations, physicians ethically can refuse patients for a variety of reasons.  Legally, this reasoning just cannot be based on the patient's race, gender, sexuality, or religion, etc.  Physicians fire patients for non-compliance all the time.

Likewise, **outside of the context of the time of care**, the physician **is** “society at large,” and is NOT bound by your misunderstanding of medical ethics.   Or, as the AMA put it in their “Code of Medical Ethics”, physicians are “free to choose whom to serve, with whom to associate, and the environment in which to provide medical care.”   In addition, malpractice insurance is generally provided by the physician’s workplace, and as such, would not cover anything outside of that workplace.  Certainly, a physician may choose to treat a stranger in public, but unless there is a strong “good Samaritan” law in their state, they’d be professionally and financially liable for any bad outcomes."

> In men, BMI had a better correlation with lean mass than with BF% 
> However, in the intermediate range of BMI (25–29.9 kg m−2), BMI failed to discriminate between BF% and lean mass in both sexes.
>The accuracy of BMI in diagnosing obesity is limited, particularly for individuals in the intermediate BMI ranges, in men and in the elderly.

So... in men BMI does a better job of measuring how much muscle someone has than fat as per that nature publication. 

In both men and women classified in the ""overweight"" range BMI isn't informative for discriminating between fit/athletic and fat.

Essentially BMI is accurate for diagnosing VERY thin people as underweight (which you could do by eyesight - the 6'2"" 120lbs guy is underweight by nearly and metric) and the morbidly obese - it's hard to be healthy at 450lbs even if you are a sumo wrestler that exercises all day.




https://www.mdalert.com/article/bmi-misclassifies-both-the-healthy-and-the-overweight

>Nearly 75 million American adults are misclassified as cardiometabolically unhealthy or cardiometabolically healthy when body mass index (BMI) categories are used as the main indicator of health.

>Conversely, nearly 30% of normal-weight individuals were misclassified by BMI as unhealthy.


https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2877506/

> By using BMI as a marker of obesity, we misclassify ≥ 50% of patients with excess body fat as being normal or just overweight and we miss the opportunity to intervene and reduce health risk in such individuals. Conversely, BMI may lead to misclassification of persons with normal levels of fat as being overweight, a fact that could cause unnecessary distress and prompt to unnecessary and costly interventions. In addition, such mislabeling has a deleterious effect on public trust for healthcare providers, particularly from fit patients with evident preserved muscle mass.

>In conclusion, despite the good correlation between BMI and BF % in a large sample of adults in the US population, the diagnostic accuracy of BMI to diagnose obesity is limited, particularly for individuals in the intermediate BMI ranges. Direct but simple measures of body fatness and measures of body fat distribution may be helpful in such individuals to further stratify them according to their level of body fatness. 



BMI is accurate in the sense that on 10000 people the average person in the range will fit expectations. It's akin to using height +/- 20% to estimate height. As in someone with a ""height measurement factor"" of 70""-modified COULD be 7' tall... or they could be 4'6""... the measure is so prone to error that it REALLY doesn't say much... but you'll likely have a better basketball team if you select a group of 100 people with an average of 80""-modified (even though most in this group will be around average height, there will likely be a fair share of tall outliers) vs one with an average of 60""-modified (also around average height... but you'll have a good chunk of short outliers)"

12/13/2021 5:04,I feel like we are trying to squeeze out the last drop of our immune system with boosters in an attempt to protect against what seems to be a new serotype (or damn near close to one). Boosting with an old antigen will soon have diminishing returns.
12/13/2021 5:04,I would honestly say to wait a bit now. You basically just got a little booster. You can probably wait at least 2 or 3 months buts just my opinion.

12/13/2021 5:03,"Get the booster. My dad and stepmom are trying to get over it right now, both had their vaccines but were due for boosters, and this is their second time getting it. My dad came down with it just over two weeks ago, and has been flat out bedridden since. Not sure how bad he REALLY got that first week as we were kept in the dark mostly, but given how bad he still is... it had to have been really bad. My stepmom got really sick as well. 

Today my sister, grandma, and I stopped by their house and stood on the driveway to say hi before my grandma left to go back to AZ, and after only 5 min of him coming down and sitting at the table in his garage, he said he felt like he needed to go lay down again. He looks like he's lost a solid 15-20 pounds as well. 

I can't stress this enough, get yourself the booster and don't take the risk. It's not worth it, at all."

12/13/2021 4:57,"> Masks were fine when they were our only option. But I’m tired of wearing masks and find myself avoiding situations that require them. We have options now - get vaccinated, ditch the mask should be the edict. 

I got COVID after getting vaccinated, in a situation where nobody was wearing masks and everybody present had either been vaccinated or had had a previous COVID infection. While clinically speaking it was a mild case -- pretty much felt like a bad cold, with couging for a couple of weeks -- I'm not enamored of the fact that it took over a month before I felt ""well"" again. One of the other people there who had athsma (and had been vaccinated) still has a nagging cough over a month later, and one who was over 65 (and had also been vaccinated) had a week of diarrhea in addition to his cough after several days of fever.

What I'm saying is that no, you're not just wearing a mask to protect anti-vaxxers. You are wearing it to protect both yourself and others who have been vaccinated as well.

P.S. everybody in this situation who was going to reproduce had already done so, so I don't really see how one could shoehorn Darwin in there."

>Such findings suggest that patients should be advised of potential cognitive effects when treated long term with benzodiazepines, although they should also be informed that the impact of such effects may be insignificant in the daily functioning of most patients.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15762814/

I understand the concern with throwing them all everyone and I think people should certainly use other solutions to help them with anxiety attacks (which those prescribed benzos are supposed to do along with taking the medication for breakthrough panic). But as someone who deals with anxiety attacks, even knowing that I have something I can take to help keeps me from spiralling. I'm glad CBD works for some but it only really helps my inflammation.

[https://cdn.pfizer.com/pfizercom/2020-11/C4591001\_Clinical\_Protocol\_Nov2020.pdf](https://cdn.pfizer.com/pfizercom/2020-11/C4591001_Clinical_Protocol_Nov2020.pdf)

The introductory text specifically justifies the study on the basis that no vaccine has been developed ""to prevent infection"":

>There are currently no licensed vaccines to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19. Given the rapid transmission of COVID-19 and incidence of disease in the United States and elsewhere, the rapid development of an effective vaccine is of utmost importance.

Here is how vaccine ""effectiveness"" is defined in the study itself:

>For Phase 2/3, the VE evaluation will be the primary objective. The VE is defined asVE = 100 × (1 – IRR), where IRR is calculated as the ratio of the first confirmed COVID-19 illness rate in the vaccine group to the corresponding illness rate in the placebo group.

Yes, prevention of severe disease was *one* endpoint in the Pfizer approval Phase 2/3 study. But the first stated primary endpoint was COVID incidence per 1000 person-years in uninfected people.

The superb success in preventing infection was trumpeted as a major victory for the new tech, and rightly so. If the approval had been based on no prevention of infection or mild-moderate disease, it would still have gone through. But nobody seriously believes that the vaccines were ""tailored"" only to ""prevent severe disease"" at the outset.

If that's the goal that we have to live with, fine. But it's embarrassing to argue that such was the goal of the vaccines at the outset."

I've always suspected that the end game for COVID is a more transmissable milder version.  It's an evolutionary advantage for a virus to not kill its host, or at least not kill it enough to reduce its hosts population significantly.

It’s true that vaccination greatly reduces your odds of becoming seriously ill but it doesn’t extinguish them.  You can stick your fingers in your ears and go “la la la” to feel better but if you want to stop realistic discussions that may not be all sunshine and rainbows that’s not a good thing.

I’m glad you didn’t get seriously ill. Your experience is an anecdote however and some people *have* suffered greatly or worse despite being vaccinated. There has to be a balance between denial and pessimism.

Does that not come with the bias that you just described above? Since majority of boosters in the UK were taken recently, it is to expect that for such people immunity has not had much time to wane.

Contrasting with people with 2 doses, who on average have way more months passed since their last vaccines.

What if it's a ticking timebomb?! 0.8% of those who recover from COVID die 6 months later.

What if there are emergent side effects?! COVID has emergent side effects now and potential for more (it damages effectively everywhere where ACE2 receptors are prolific, so like the hypothalamic gyrus, brain stem, spinal cord, pancreas, GI tract, genitals, etc.)

What if it causes infertility? Again, it causes damage to the genitals. Especially in men. Early signs show that it affects spermatogenesis and testosterone secretion."

What we don’t know is if T-cell related immune responses have been significantly weakened over time (harder to study). Those T-cell responses are the foundation of long-term immunity after vaccination. We don’t know what boosters do to that specific response either. We also don’t know how effective the T-cell response to alpha will be for omicron. And on top of that, we don’t know if risk of severe illness or death from Covid had dropped significantly in the vaccinated due to omicron. We also don’t know how long the boost in immunity lasts (we only have data for a few weeks). If the only thing weakened is antibodies, we can’t expect more than a month or two of improvement.

If you stay current on your vaccines you have very little to worry about with Covid. Had a delta breakthrough infection. It was a weird cold that gave me a headache. I’ve been far sicker with other things. 

Get vaccinated, get boosted as often as is needed, and live your life. Obviously if you have major comorbidities that calculus changes but for the vast majority of vaccinated people there’s very little to worry about. A breakthrough infection isn’t a death sentence."

12/13/2021 4:21,"Everything has been based on antibody neutralization studies so far, so there is a lot of speculation on what severity the symptoms actually are. 

It seems like most people are making the assumption that if your protection from infection is weaker, so will your protection from severe disease. For the most part that seems to be true, but it is not necessarily true.

That being said, from the antibody studies, pushing boosters are mostly a last resort with respect to Omicron. The antibodies you get from boosters are the same as the original vaccination series, but there are a lot more of them (like A LOT more), so we are brute forcing our protection until an omicron booster can be made and approved (likely 6+ months from now)."

12/13/2021 4:21,"Thank you for making this important point.

Covid is highly transmissible before severe disease even occurs. There is not much evolutionary pressure for it to become milder. True that it might. But if that happens, we certainly don't have a timeline for it."

A simple cold turned into pneumonia and hospitalized her just a year before the pandemic started.

I guess, the reason for the wave being milder is semantics whether its due to the variant being innately less virulent or whether previous infection & vaccine's make it less so."

This is why they are up shit’s creek without a paddle. Add to that exhausted HCWs and depleted NHS and it’s gonna be a very sad situation. Hopefully the populace gets fucking pissed enough after watching their loved ones die of “air starvation” at home right in front of them, to throw out that shit Conservative govt that got them to this mess.

12/14/2021 15:56,Hysteria like this one.... As you can see it overestimated the impact of covid quite substantially.... This is just the first link a search came up with.... Hysteria.... Looking backwards.... Though indeed the impact has been terrible
12/14/2021 15:55,Except it's not going to sit at 200k/day. By the end of the week it'll be roughly a million/day.
12/14/2021 15:55,"Thanks to lack of supply in Canada, I have 9 weeks between doses 1 And 2, and 6 months form my booster last week..

Yaay?? Lol"
12/14/2021 15:55,"Fucking hell... I'm going back to Redding in February and I was looking forward to not feeling that boiling rage for all the idiots around me.

Looks like I'll have to shorten my stay to keep my sanity."
12/14/2021 15:55,Now how many of the 27 will go on TikTok and cry about “‘muh rights”? That app is already lousy with fired nurses doing the same.
12/14/2021 15:55,"In Canada (or at least Ontario, as every province is different) the indoor mask mandate went into effect in early 2020 and hasn't stopped since, aside from a few edge cases. I haven't walked through any door that wasn't attached to my home without a mask in nearly two years.

I had kind of assumed the same was true about most states, but I guess not!"
12/14/2021 15:55,"But isn’t it the non vaxxed who are filling up the emergency rooms? Not the vaxxed?

Me being vaxxed and wearing two masks doesn’t help me at all if I get into a car accident.  The emergency room will still be full of the non vaxxed, not my vaxxed brethren. 

If we are not going to mandate the vaccine and if everyone who wants one has the vaccine, then the only way to have more spots available in the ER is to build more beds and to bring on more staff."
12/14/2021 15:55,"> But not many in the US got J&J 

That's true. Us J&J folks are kinda in a bind."

12/14/2021 15:53,"I'd love an answer - but at this point the only thing that is going to convince an anti-covid vaccine parent is a sick child in my opinion, and as a parent that hurts to even say."
12/14/2021 15:53,Let's hope that people are smart enough to take it when it's on the market.
12/14/2021 15:53,"That’s not the real number.  The system was designed to have 150 excess beds for surge needs with 2,300 total ICU beds.  It was bumped up to 3,400 beds during the height of covid.  Now we’re having staffing shortages so that’s adding strain."
12/14/2021 15:53,Not liking that uptick right at the end there...
12/14/2021 15:52,"The only kids affected are thise whose parents dont parent.

Stop blaming others for your shortcomings"
12/14/2021 15:51,This is for the total of admissions. I wrote solely about 2x vaccinated.
12/14/2021 15:51,"Yh 70% is better than i expected especially after seeing results that it wasn't very effective against symptoms. But good to know still gives a decent level of protection against hospitalization. Only a drop of 20% compared to pfizer i think. 

Haven't got much hope for one J&J though considering wasn't that the least effective against Delta. IIRC it was like 77% effective against hospitalization for Delta. Maybe then only 50% or below for Omicron. But not many in the US got J&J vast majority had pfizer/moderna"
12/14/2021 15:51,"If they have the supplies, I’m certain that they’ll push through approval."
12/14/2021 15:51,"You talking about their antibody treatment?

12/14/2021 15:51,This translates to 1 in 48 people getting covid in a week.
12/14/2021 15:51,"We’re still in the middle of the plague inc game, not the end game.  We still need to be diligent and take precautions."
12/14/2021 15:51,"It's not horribly expensive to invest in air purifiers. The way your company did it however is less effective and more expensive then just buying a HEPA air purifier.

The conference room where you are doing testing absolutely doesn't need a wall of air purifiers. You can achieve reasonably clean air (6 ACH) with one larger HEPA air purifier.

I've done a jobs where we implement air filters in large hotels for closer to $15k. Filters are only in common areas, not hotel rooms.

Throwing a filter in a single small office doesn't cost more than $150. In a large office common area it might cost $1,000. The ongoing filter replacement every 6 months can add up however.

Central HVAC applications can be expensive and in our testing have also been significantly less effective than a simple air purifier in the center of a room."
12/14/2021 15:50,"There are still issues with bringing the virus home for some people though. While I’m young and healthy (plus fully vaccinated) I’m fairly confident I’ll stay out of the ground; however I have two immunocompromised people in my life that are still at a big risk even if it’s a milder strain. This is why i was hoping the booster would help with prevention, puts less of a worry on my shoulders."
12/14/2021 15:50,"There are many pathogens besides COVID. Things like masking and social distancing were also effective against them. As such, now that things have opened back up, they are circulating a lot more again. To be safe, definitely go get tested."
12/14/2021 15:50,"I believe the gov allowed the vaccines to be rushed, but I don't think this pill falls under the same agreement"
12/14/2021 15:49,"France has the exact same problem, we can just see it more in Britain because we sequence more."
12/14/2021 15:49,It’s an R4 with a case doubling rate of 2 days.  It’d take 1 case to infect the entire us population in 30 days. Masks and vaccinations are important.
12/14/2021 15:49,Then how do they get SA infected figures since South Africa doesn't exactly test a bunch of people. They're doing like less than 60k tests a dsy usually which isn't a lot considering they have 59m people. Till date i think they've done 3m tests only
12/14/2021 15:49,"It's a 70% reduction before infection, not after. So, the 33% reduction in infection the study found contributes to the 70% reduction in hospitalization risk."
12/14/2021 15:49,"Healthcare is what corporations tell you it is. Cyberpunk af.

12/14/2021 15:49,"If you are an adult in the US, you are eligible, period.  You don’t have to say anything."
12/14/2021 15:47,"My point is that is basically what the fda is doing

They aren’t doing their own research! They are trusting Pfizer 

But they are taking months to do it for no reason"
12/14/2021 15:47,"Don’t forget the AstraZeneca/GSK pill, it’s supposed to be good as well"
12/14/2021 15:47,Bodies pilling up would pose other problems. We need to bring back leper colonies... and the first one can be Texas.

12/14/2021 15:46,It’s based on inferences from death rates. The *PFR* of SA is >0.3%. Demographic adjustments on the death rate easily get you into 70-90% if the population having had it.

So if the profit margins are super slim on a vaccine - they probably get a government ""assistance"" pack for providing the vaccines its scraps compared to what your insurance is going to pay for real prescription drugs over your life.

Does that sound right to you ?"
12/14/2021 15:45,"That's extremely reliant on how fast they can produce the pill and at what price. Traditionally most non-vaccine solutions are much more expensive.

To really get the result you want you need to get this virus under control globally and that means your treatment needs to be something everyone can afford. 

Vaccines are nice because when they work they are a cheap solution.

I suspect COVID will mutate toward common cold status faster than we can do anything about it at this new rate of infection and previous immunity resistance. 

It's probably more common than we think zoonotic viruses like coronavirus to transfer over from animals cause a bunch of trouble but also rapidly mutate toward a highly prolific common cold status.

At the end of the day viral load has no advantage to the virus, just propagation, so it has every evolutionary incentive to drop severity and embrace things like rate of transmission or an ability to dodge pre-existing immunity or resistance. 

Now you can't guarantee that outcome and you can't know exactly how fast it might happen, but given the huge drop in severity with omicron and the huge jump in rate of infection I think the chances have actually increased significantly that we're going to see a rapid transition to common cold status."
12/14/2021 15:45,I know. It's ridiculous.  It ends up being yet another reason the unvaccinated are reluctant to go get it done and yet the media blabbers on about it endlessly.
12/14/2021 15:45,"I understand that antibody numbers wane, but are the body’s responses equal for every shot, or is there a mounting response from multiple exposures triggering a bigger wave of antibodies from the 3rd shot, in addition to countering the waning numbers ?

12/14/2021 15:45,Not necessarily true. When talking about Omicron in the German study (I believe it was) mild was self reported by the participants. That's definitely not the same as mild from a medical perception.

12/14/2021 15:44,"Hospitals should implement policies stating that unvaccinated people over the age of five will only be treated for COVID if and when there is room. Friends I know who are nurses (and I assume doctors feel the same way) are burned out, angry and on the verge of collapse.

If you show up at the hospital with COVID, you should be required to show a vaccine card. If you don't have one, you wait like everyone else.

Even better would be for some hospitals to simply say ""we are not going to treat COVID"" PERIOD so that people with heart attacks, strokes, agonizing pain from delayed surgeries, etc. can feel safe going to the hospital."
12/14/2021 15:44,"Well…. Seeing that serious outcome for COVID primarily affects people with comorbidities, than it stands to reason that those same people are at risk for sudden death… irrespective of COVID status or past infections. In my opinion, there is nothing remotely surprising about this. 

Not sure the two can be directly correlated without looking specifically to see if the deaths are actually delayed complications of COVID though."
12/14/2021 15:43,"It's possible, (and actually somewhat likely, given what we know from other vaccines) that the big gain from a booster is partially how long it's been between doses.

If we weren't in a pandemic, we might not need the dose 3-4 weeks after the first. We would just need two doses six months apart. Or a year apart."
12/14/2021 15:43,so not being vaccinated is the same as opening fire into a crowd of people? gotcha
12/14/2021 15:42,"Ok but Pfizer did the study and showed it is safe right ?

The blame rests squarely on every unvaccinated person and in every vaccinated person who is now saying selfishly I do not need to wear a mask,distance, or meet in only small groups. It is clear that the vaccinated are behaving in just as reprehensible ways as the unvaxed with just as little care or empathy. Omnicron will find any crack it can.

12/14/2021 15:38,"1. At this point, with Omicron being so contagious, is it realistic to think that all of us are eventually going to be exposed to COVID at some point? I ask this as a vaccinated and boosted person who works remotely full time and wears masks indoors. It just seems that, with 1 in 7 people already having had the disease, exposure is simply inevitable.
2. At some point, can those who refuse to get the vaccine be moved down the priority list for hospital care so that those with heart attacks and strokes, and people in intense pain for things like hips and joints, can get treatment or is that still considered unethical?

I didn’t get jabbed 3 times so that I have to put up with indefinite mask mandates with constantly moving goalposts. Also masks don’t do jackshit in a 100% packed like sardines bar/restaurant where they make you put it on for 30 seconds from when you check in until you get to your table.  Funny how people who have no issues wearing 10 masks on their face for the rest of their lives claim to have high morals and anyone who feels the other way is a crying baby throwing tantrum.

12/14/2021 15:31,"It's certainly possible. And to be clear, things are going to be much better than I was worried about. Omicron isn't quite gentle enough that I can stop masking, social distancing, and getting boosters to protect my 18-month daughter, but it's also still detectable via PCR test and not mutated enough to evade boosted immune systems, so my daughter might still see her grandparents for Christmas.

To the original comment's credit, of course, it's worth remembering that we're grading this pandemic on a sliding scale that goes from ""people die"" to ""billions of people die"", on which ""good"" is a highly subjective term. ""Not as bad as I thought it would be"" seems to be where everyone ranks ""good"", and many people seem to be thinking Omicron would be much worse. 

Omicron is worse than I feared in some ways (significant breakthrough infections are going to make high local vaccination rates meaningless for people trying to protect the unvaccinated), and better in others (extensive data suggesting that it's milder on SA-like populations, and also a trickle or comforting data for UK-like populations).

Would I call it ""good"" news, though? I would not. ""Good"" news would have been that Omicron was 99.99% less deadly than COVID for all demographics, and infection with Omicron protected against Delta. ""Good"" news would have been that Omicron lacked a presymptomatic and asymptomatic infectious phase, and people could stop spreading COVID without realizing. Omicron looking like it's not going to kill 10x more people than Delta is not the worst. But that's not good."

>Staff Report
December 13, 2021 at 5:11 p.m.

>Leaders of Minnesota hospital systems are pleading with the public to get vaccinated for COVID-19 and to take precautions such as wearing a mask as hospitalizations for the virus remain at record highs for 2021.

>CEOs of nine Minnesota health systems — Allina Health, Children’s Minnesota, Fairview Health Systems, HealthPartners, Hennepin Healthcare, North Memorial Health, Essentia Health, Mayo Clinic and CentraCare — purchased full-page advertisements in newspapers across the state calling for the public to take the virus more seriously. The ad ran in Sunday’s Pioneer Press.

>“We’re heartbroken. We’re overwhelmed” the full-page ad was headlined.

>“Our doctors, nurses and people working in health care are doing everything we can to take care of you when you’re sick,” the ad said. “And yet every day we’re seeing avoidable illness and death as a direct result of COVID19.

>“Our emergency departments are overfilled, and we have patients in every bed in our hospitals. This pandemic has strained our operations and demoralized many people on our teams. … Now an ominous question looms: will you be able to get care from your local community hospital without delay? Today, that’s uncertain.”

>Hospitalizations in Minnesota reached 1,677 on Friday, according to numbers released Monday by the Minnesota Department of Health. Nearly 99 percent of the state’s 1,012 adult intensive care unit beds were full, with 342 of those beds occupied by a person sick with COVID-19.

>The ad went on to ask: “How can we as a society stand by and watch people die when a simple shot could prevent a life-threatening illness? Your health care is being seriously threatened by COVID19. We need to stop the spread!”

>The ad urged Minnesotans to get vaccinated, including booster doses; wear a mask (even if vaccinated) and socially distance; get tested if feeling sick; and encourage “neighbors and loved ones” to do the same.

>“We’re in this together, and we can only finish it together,” the ad concluded.

12/14/2021 15:28,"1/3 as severe as the original SA wave, which was a variant less severe than Delta. And that is for unvaccinated individuals.

It's ""3x more transmissible"" than Delta, but what you mean is it has an R0 of 3x that of Delta. It's not 3x that of the original wave.

You're comparing apples to elephants.

100 individuals who would have been hospitalized in the initial COVID wave now are only 71 individuals (confidence intervals notwithstanding). If they were vaccinated with 2 doses of Pfizer, that would be 21 individuals. 3 doses (or perhaps recency of a dose) provide even more protection, per a separate study.

This study does not give hard numbers on hospital status, but the remarks that go along with it indicate that those who are hospitalized are staying less time, fewer are requiring oxygen or the ICU, and fewer are being ventilated. Compared to the initial wave even. And yes, compared to the same population previously."

>  
>The virus is heavily mutated that escapes the first line of defence (antibodies) but it's still covid so your body recognizes it and you can recover faster so it's looks like it's a mild variant.

The interesting bit to me is that the average length of hospital stay is increasing. Earlier in the Omicron wave, the average hospital stay was 2.8 days. To me, this could be caused by two factors: Demographic change in infections and sampling bias. If only concluded stays are included in the statistic, it will naturally be biased towards those with shorter stays in the beginning. Thus we expect average stay to increase over time. If it is due to a change in the demographics of the wave, then that also has an impact on the observed mildness of Omicron. In that case, it suggests that Omicron has been observed to be milder simply because it has hit a different demographic than Delta early on."

12/14/2021 15:14,"From the article: Kroger is eliminating some Covid-19 benefits for unvaccinated employees, a move to encourage inoculations as the Biden administration’s vaccine mandate faces legal challenges.

The Cincinnati-based grocery chain told employees last week that it will no longer provide two weeks of paid emergency leave for unvaccinated employees who contract Covid-19, unless local jurisdictions require otherwise. Kroger will also add a $50 monthly surcharge to company health plans for unvaccinated managers and other nonunion employees, according to a memo viewed by The Wall Street Journal. Both policies are effective Jan. 1, the memo said.

Kroger, one of the biggest employers in the U.S. with almost half a million full-time and part-time employees, is tightening pandemic-related policies for workers as U.S. businesses face continued uncertainty over federal vaccination mandates. Rules issued by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in November require employers with 100 or more workers to ensure employees are vaccinated or take weekly Covid-19 tests by Jan. 4.

Whether those rules, which were targeted by lawsuits across the country, will take effect is uncertain. Last week, a U.S. court blocked the plan to mandate vaccines for federal contractors. General Electric Co. and others have since suspended vaccine requirements for employees. A federal appeals court in Cincinnati is considering whether to reinstate the administration’s rules for employers."

After multiple rounds of reviews and responses from the authors, both of the preprints were published ([the first one](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-02461-2) and [the second one](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-02096-3)). These published versions are more detailed and respond to the authors responses to our criticism, please read these instead of the preprints for more details.

Now a week later, today, in December 2021, which is 9 months later, the original paper is retracted.

Edit: I would like to add that none of this would have been possible if the authors did not share their code and materials online, following good transparency practices. We originally highlighted the importance of that during COVID in an article that criticised the threatening lack of transparency of COVID-19 papers available [here](https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-021-01304-y)."
12/14/2021 15:03,"true, but they are the same country they were a few months ago when delta hit. if their total hospitalization is half of delta, wouldn't it likely be half of delta for most places? or 3/4th? or 69% as much, whatever it might be?"
12/14/2021 15:03,"It's a 70 percent reduction compared to unvaccinated individuals. Not that 30 percent of vaccinated individuals with cases will be hospitalized.

That's less protection with 2 doses than with Delta, but they are measuring a baseline hospitalization rate 29 percent below the original South Africa wave, which was less dangerous than Delta was.

It's a confirmation that just looking at hospitalization (not ventilation, icu or oxygenation), this variant is less severe than all previous variants. And 2 doses still provide 70 percent protection against severe disease compared to an unvaccinated individual."

Let me give you a little insight.  It's ok to want your government to do better.  But what do I know?  I'm only an American living in Canada to went back to the US to get both shots before most people in Canada had their first.  I also got my booster a little over a week ago by coming back.

We'll know more in a month, but there's a chance Omicron could be more lethal for unvaccinated and less lethal for vaccinated. That's my biggest fear. I have relatives who live north of Denver who are very anti-vaxx and they have 7 kids. As angry as I am at them for being so foolish, I'm scared for them and think about them often throughout the day.

Point is, an increase of $150 would almost send an understated message that there's only a small increase in risk. Have them sign assume risks with hospitalization by having them sign their house and car over. That'd give a more accurate message."

From march 2020 I was 100% sure that everybody will sooner or later get this virus, with the only question open how many people can we protect from dying through vaccinations and medical advancements.

It was never realistic to protect people from infection. It's like trying to protect people from coming into contact with the flu. That's just not possible in my eyes.


70% protection with existing vaccines is great, when you consider that we knew from the beginning of omicrons emerge that they offer next to no protection against infection.

This shows us that the protection offered by these vaccines is extremely durable and will help us to come to an endemic state, where the will be waves every winter without a bing strain on the hospitals, regardless of the virus mutating or not."

India took off because Delta had first been identified by Dec 2020 and by March immunity of infection from wave 1 had diminished enough that without high vaccination and an open country the wave was going to come regardless like in almost every other country in the world later which couldn't stop it even with hindsight which India lacked at that time"

1. Current reports from the ground in SA showing that hospitalisations  are tracking at around Delta rates right now despite many more cases, and actually lower in terms of ventilation; meanwhile, tentative signs that case growth is slowing in Gauteng

2. Shorter hospital turnarounds, helping capacity a lot

3. Boosters going into arms very quickly in the West

Not saying that what you said isn't a possibility, but it's a worst case scenario, and plenty of other factors need to be considered."

The same happened with Delta when everyone was surpised that UK's infections suddenly fell and did not follow prior calculations. Of course we need a few more days to gather data, but if the infections follow this trend combined with the newly published data about severity this looks rather positive. 

If this is the case, the focus should lie on slowly building up natural immunity among the unvaccinated and give everyone else the max. vaccine protection even if some get infected. 

I am in no way against restrictions like wearing a mask or social distancing, but it seems like this variant could be the safest way to date to build up natural immunity and slowly end the pandemic without straining hospitals (following reports from SA's hospital situation)"
12/14/2021 14:25,B-B-But !!!!  that doesnt fit the narrative !?
12/14/2021 14:24,Your concern above is justified. Those debating you don't seem to comprehend as you do that these figures combined with greatly increased transmissibility are not good news at all. 70% effectiveness against hospitalisation would still lead to millions of hospitalisations in a short period and therefore overloaded hospitals.
12/14/2021 14:24,"Your ICU capacity number is incorrect. Elective surgeries are more or less completely stopped at closer to 300-400 (and there's still some exceptions like deceased transplants where they can't really be delayed), the 150 number is where they start to be impacted. We got close to 200 in the fall and we had some spotty interruptions in surgeries, but were nowhere close to complete cancellations.

Also for anyone else reading that isn't total ICU capacity, just an estimate of how much additional capacity we have for COVID. Actual ICU capacity is much, much higher."
12/14/2021 14:24,"Today: 

1. Omicron much milder, leads to less hospitalization than Delta

2. Pfizer vaccine still works pretty well, much less drop in effectiveness as feared 

3. Pfizer pill does well (and very likely also vs Omicron)"
12/14/2021 14:24,"Yea it really should be discussed more.  I suspected something along these lines which is why we continue to mask indoors despite being boosted ever since delta came out (also we have a kid too young for vaccinations).  I understand people who don’t want to mask because they’ve done everything right, but covid isn’t fair and nobody ever said that it would stop being a problem entirely once vaccinated.  We have to follow where the virus takes us and until we stop giving it places to thrive and mutate it won’t go away."

12/14/2021 14:23,"It does seem to be the case that lockdowns curb the number of infections in the short term, and alleviate hospitalization rates, but as seen from the high mutation rate of COVID-19 virus, lockdowns have a negligible impact in the long run. One person can infect a nation, given the right scenario.

Also it is not a practical method, many countries that have zero covid policy changed their perspective. 

This solution of fully fledged lockdowns might work at the very beginning of pandamic, when cases were less than couple of thousands world wide, before being a pandamic. 

And what will happen next year when a new variant comes out, we will be back to ground zero in a never-ending catch 22 cycle."

12/14/2021 14:17,"Because under the delta plateau of the last few months the ONS survey determined that over each 7 day period, about 1 in 60 to 65 people would have tested positive for covid, so about 1-1.1 million cases per week or about 150k cases per day. At other times the proportion of people positive for covid was even higher, it has got up to 1 in 50 which is about 190-200k per day. So basically 200k per day is high but not anything that hasn't been experienced previously.

The ONS survey provides a population level estimate so accounts for all of the cases that normal testing misses. In other words, you have 50k per day which are detected through regular testing and symptomatic testing, them another 150k which aren't detected because those people aren't doing regular testing and their symptoms are probably mild enough or non-existent so they don't test for that reason."

Obesity does increase the risk of hospitalization by a lot, but it doesn't increase the risk of death by a lot. Omicron will increase the odds of you getting infected, but it is very unlikely to increase the odds of dying. There is no age group for which the virus has a 50% mortality rate, even if you take the oldest people and add all the risk conditions. 

If everyone catch Omicron quickly, the unvaccinated at-risk population will suffer, and healthcare workers will suffer. Hospitals collapsing doesn't mean we don't get healthcare, it means each nurse have to look after 10 patients instead of his/her usual 4 patients. It would suck for everyone, but as long as we don't run out of oxygen, this will probably not have a huge impact on the survival of hospitalized cases."

12/14/2021 14:13,">The heavily mutated Omicron variant has led to a serious dent in the ability of vaccines to protect us from catching the Covid virus.

>Two doses of some vaccines offer almost no protection from an Omicron infection, although they should still greatly reduce the risk of becoming so ill you need hospital care.

>The vaccines were all developed to fight the first form of the virus that emerged two years ago.

>So can a third or ""booster"" dose of those original vaccines make the difference or has Omicron already outwitted the protection they can give?

>Fortunately for us - while the contents of the syringe may be identical, a booster is not just more of the same for the immune system.

>The protection you're left with after the third dose is bigger, broader and more memorable than you had before.

>Covid school

>Fighting coronavirus is something your immune system has to learn.

>One option is to figure it out on the job when you encounter the virus for real. However, there is a risk of getting it wrong and ending up seriously ill.

>Vaccines are more like a school - a safer environment to further your immune system's Covid education.

>The first dose is the primary school education that nails the fundamentals.

>Your second and third doses are comparable to sending your immune system to secondary school and then university to dramatically deepen its understanding. It's not just repeating primary school over and over.

>”The immune system is left with a richer knowledge and understanding of the virus,"" said Prof Jonathan Ball, a virologist from the University of Nottingham.

>He said for all the talk of the dastardly tricks of Omicron, a highly-trained immune system is ""an incredibly difficult and hostile environment"" for the virus and its variants.

Antibodies are a major beneficiary of this education.
These are the sticky proteins that attach themselves to the outside of the coronavirus. Neutralising antibodies can gum up the virus so it can't invade your cells. Others sit there as the biological equivalent of a flashing neon sign spelling out ""kill this virus"".
A flurry of laboratory studies and real world data showed the neutralising antibodies you have after two doses of a Covid vaccine were far less effective against Omicron.
Prof Danny Altmann, an immunologist from Imperial College London, said you were left with ""absolutely zilch"" and were a ""sitting duck for infection"".

So back to school.

Every dose of the vaccine triggers another round of antibody evolution within the immune system. It seeks out better antibodies that attach themselves more firmly to the virus. It's a process called affinity maturation.

""Your antibodies are a better fit as time goes on, they are getting fancier and more sophisticated,"" said Prof Altmann.

If the antibodies are able to bind more tightly to the coronavirus then it will be harder for Omicron's mutations to help it wriggle free. And while the new variant is heavily mutated, it is still the same fundamental virus and has parts that have not changed at all.

Further rounds of vaccination also lead to the immune system broadening its antibody repertoire as it finds new ways of attacking the virus.

Numbers game

It's not just about the quality of antibodies, the quantity goes up with boosting too.
Prof Charles Bangham, from Imperial, said: ""You get more of them, the concentration in the blood increases and we don't know how long this is going to last, but the more times you're vaccinated the longer-lasting the immune memory is.""

The impact of all this is clear in the same studies that showed two doses were weaker against Omicron. The protection against getting any Covid symptoms shot up to around 75% after the booster.

Elsewhere in the immune system, boosting is giving our bodies the upper hand against future variants too.

B-cells are the part of the body that mass produce antibodies. Some mature to produce those super-sticky, highly refined antibodies after boosting. Others can spot coronavirus, but remain half-baked and flexible.

""These can go off in different directions and when they proliferate they start to go after the new variant,"" said Prof Ball.

And then there's T-cells, which again become more plentiful and better at attacking Covid viruses in response to boosting.

T-cells use a different trick to spot the virus and patrol our body looking for any sign of cells being infected with Covid. T-cells recognise parts of the coronavirus that the virus finds harder to mutate.

So while Omicron is squirming away from our immune system, each vaccine dose and indeed each infection is giving our body's defences more tools to hunt it down.

All this bodes well for vaccines protecting us from becoming seriously ill.

""Immunity against a virus is almost never absolute - you can almost always get re-infected and what you want to do is get re-infection so trivial you don't know you've got it or it's very mild,"" said Prof Bangham."

This underscores the treatment candidate’s potential to save the lives of patients around the world,” said Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer. “Emerging variants of concern, like Omicron, have exacerbated the need for accessible treatment options for those who contract the virus, and we are confident that, if authorized or approved, this potential treatment could be a critical tool to help quell the pandemic.”"

12/14/2021 14:11,"Yes of course you are right on that.

This probably means more measures or lockdowns till we have a new vaccine but less risk on the individual level.

I mean even with Delta it was already so transmissible that everybody would get it sooner or later (at least the unvaxxed) and now with this new variant it's probably sooner, but with a lower risk.


It's not optimal, but it's far better than everything we could hope for when we first heard of that new variant infecting people like crazy.
Just image severity on par or above delta. We would be doomed."

So if you truly believe you did the right thing by vaccinating yourself, why do the decisions of others bother you? What about their own personal health choice has any effect on you? The government has moved their end goal 100s of times already since the start of this, they keep making illogical promises and setting out benchmarks that the public meets, only to be told they now need to reach a new goal. Then CNN tells you to hate on your neighbours for being the reason the government keeps changing it's mind. I don't think it's fair to any of you as citizens and tax payers."

There won't be such a study for a while and it'll be merely confirmatory in any case; the study you really want (but let's be honest, won't read anyway) will be along in a few months once that data can actually be got and collected.

This ""blah blah show me a study"" nonsense is just that, because you *clearly* are not qualified to make use of it, you're using science as rhetorical device to make political argument, which is like saying ""Pythagoras was a big fan of triangles and that's why circles are stupid"". It's just *nonsense*.

You're on a computer arguing with a stranger because, over sixty-thousand years, your species has figured out how to throw electrons or photons down miles of cabling into a machine that can, by spinning a disc a few thousand times a second, flip the charge of individual units of silicon and later translate that into logical statements that subsequently turn electrical impulses into ordered trios of color that update *en masse* sixty-seven times a second in order that you can read these words.

You either trust that science is a real thing that does stuff you don't understand, or you pull up your pants like a big kid and go learn the science yourself.

You don't get to sit there demanding strangers bring you things that you don't even understand don't need to currently exist, let alone how to read, let alone have an opinion on.

You are a fool. An embarrassing, arrogant fool, who's been lied to by rich people who *know* you are a fool and are laughing as their fortunes swell behind millions of you dying. 

You actually *are* being targeted and manipulated,  its painfully obvious, and the proof of it is everywhere, but you are too lazy to actually do any real work, having a stupid, ignorant, ridiculous opinion is more important to you.

*Show me the study*.

The fuck would you do with it? You'd be lost three sentences into the methods and data is meaningless without it.

12/14/2021 14:01,"Masks reducing transmission is data driven, backed by many, many studies. Putting states next to each other the way everyone seems to now and pointing to one factor out of many as the reason their COVID numbers differ is not data driven or scientific."

12/14/2021 14:01,"That's great news.

Especially since it seems like Omicron leads to less hospitalisations in general, so 70% of a lower baseline might actually be less than the 90% against the higher delta baseline."

12/14/2021 13:59,"In theory yes, but you also need to factor in things like hospital turnaround times which seem to be much quicker (almost halved in some age groups I believe.) There's an emerging clinical picture coming out of SA and it suggests that hospitals are not being overwhelmed or on track to be overwhelmed, yet."
12/14/2021 13:59,it applies to vaxed too. since the new variant don't give a shit about your vax status.
12/14/2021 13:58,"If Delta would have infected 100,000 people and killed 950 in a wave, and Omicron is 4 times more transmissible, at 60% severity it would infect 400,000 people and kill 2280 people before accounting for hospital overrun.

Boosters are good news. Compared to being more severe the way Delta was vs. Alpha and Wuhan, less severe is certainly better news.

If we're calculating total death toll, though? A hypothetical world with just Delta may still see fewer COVID deaths than the one we live in.

So in that sense, Omicron still isn't good news.

I'm with you on Omicron looking to not be the apocalypse, though. Very grateful for the world not ending quite yet."

There are few people in South Africa who have not caught the virus thus the baseline for a severe outcome regardless of vaccination status is now higher than it used to be in the immune naive population hence even if the vaccine protection remained exactly the same the percentage protection compared to the unvaccinated would decrease.

The correct interpretation is 70% protection against hospitalization compared to unvaccinated.....who themselves mainly have significant protection against hospitalization because of prior infection."

12/14/2021 13:34,"Sadly the great automoderator engine won’t allow me to post references to news sites like the guardian but a web search will get you there in no time. If Google is not showing it, DuckDuckGo does for sure. 

The 11% statistic was stated by an NHS exec that was interviewed on the news in the last two days (can’t remember which but I think it was BBC). But the guardian has the article stating 10,000 beds held by elderly patients ready to discharge. 

They also have the articles for the issue highlighted back in September about the existing care home staff shortage (100,000 vacancies) and the impact the November deadline could have. 
And last week, again on the guardian (will be other sites too) that a care home in Kent had to shut down due to staff shortages and gave families 10hrs to take their loved one out.

This demonstrates the impact these mandates are now having on wider health care when simply including testing to these settings from the start would have provided a much safer environment for the residents from the beginning and prevented the impact that it now being felt by a constipation of hospital patient flow due to the reduction in onward care facilities.

I know that many stuck at home during lockdowns will have found it harder to be motivated into getting fit or healthy, but if there was ever a time to bang that drum to motivate people into positive change, how could it not be during a pandemic. 
Lockdowns weren’t forever and there were still things that could be done even while at home.

Yes it’s easy to just get a vaccine, but that’s a short term answer to a wider problem in health. One of the main comorbidities I understand is obesity, and that requires a long term solution, which 18 months of messaging from the governments and media and failed to attempt to address. 

Vaccines are obviously very important, but this pandemic requires multiple strategies to combat the impact it’s having to everyone’s lives globally."

What it means is that it will clear the virus of SARS-CoV-2 and they are less likely to develop disease. But what we know from people that are HIV and not on antiretroviral therapy successfully is that they're going to stay longer infected and they're going to have a worse clinical outcome. And that's not only specifically to HIV, but any kind of immunosuppressive disease, such as cancer.

Prior to Covid being a thing, she was very active. The city she lived in is very senior friendly - card groups, board game groups, weekly restaurant dining groups were just a few of what she was part of. Plus she walked daily.

Then the isolation of Covid times hit and she went straight downhill. She decided it was time to go into a nursing home, because she was having trouble with cooking, dishes and balance. My Mom was going there daily (retired and isolated) to so things for her but she didn't want to be a trouble to her.

SO...Medicaid has 1 option around here for nursing homes. My Mom got it all set up. Supposedly they work with your doc on any meds you need to get that transferred over to the nursing home staff. My Grandma was on a nebulizer daily treatment. She got there, and they said, ""Sorry - no nebulizers due to Covid!""

Sure enough, this really was a thing. Because of the vapors produced by a nebulizer they were disallowed at most places across the Nation once covid came along. They were supposed to have prescribed her an inhaler instead (think Primatene Mist commercials) but hadn't. My grandma was calling my mom out of breath, barely able to talk, and crying that she couldn't breathe and no one would give her medicine. My grandma and my mom both even called 911 for an ambulance finally. All that red tape put my Grandma in the hospital. Long story short, she caught Covid and died.

Maybe it wasn't due to her being poor and on medicaid, and just a huge lack of communication, but I don't know. Having to call for an ambulance yourself?! I guess her oxygen saturation was so low they don't know how she was even able to make the last phone call before going to the hospital.

Protection of 2 doses of #Pfizer @ hospital admission due to #Omicron is maintained across all ages (18-79 years), but slightly lower for older age groups:

18-29: 92%

30-39: 75%

40-49: 82%

50-59: 74%

60-69: 67%

70-79: 59%

very good results so far (older people were vaccinated first, but it likely changes with boosters for them)"
12/14/2021 12:36,"-	Massive excess deaths because of healthcare system collapse 
-	long lasting damage to the healthcare system because more healthcare professionals will quit after another wave exhausts them physically and emotionally
-	potential shortages in many areas of society because many people will be sick at once. This is not exaggerated btw, even Delta has caused a shortage of bus drivers in my city to the point bus frequency had to be reduced, in a country with very good transport. 
-	Many left with long-covid, unable to participate in economy for potentially years (assuming long  covid rates will be similar for Omikron as for Delta) 
-	Traumatization of whole communities, similar as in Bergamo in Spring 2020 or NY on 9/11. 
-	Possible further evolution of the virus with more immune escape (whether or not virulence will go up or down is anyone‘s guess). 

In short, these are some short and long term consequences we could likely face if Omikron rolls through countries unfazed by restrictions or measures."
12/14/2021 12:36,"> is it basically a 50/50 on who lives?

The case fatality rate is nowhere even close to 50%.

There is zero benefit to scaring yourself in this way. 

You've had your two doses, which might not protect you from infection, but should still protect you from severe disease, hospitalisation, or death.

Having said that, it seems likely that a great number of people are going to catch Omicron. I'm not convinced it will be literally everyone (even the most infectious diseases rarely find everyone), and I'm not convinced it'll all happen over the next 2 weeks (due to social interventions and booster drives, which should delay and flatten the wave), but it is coming for many of us over the next couple of months, and its worth being prepared (i.e. jabbed + boosted) for that eventuality."

12/14/2021 12:32,"The author of the article is on the team that analyzes the Covid data in Gauteng and it looks like she has access to details not published anywhere else (I’ve searched).

The most interesting data is the table 3/4 down the page showing the hospitalized cases by age. 

Across all age groups, the average length of hospital stay for the omicron wave is 4 days shorter than prior waves (4-7 days vs 8-11 days).

Importantly, for the 60+ age group (which accounts for >80% of deaths globally), the average length of stay is only 6-7 days…which is actually shorter than the 8-10 days for those aged under-40 in prior waves.

Also, up to 52% of hospitalized cases may be incidental. Hospitals test all admissions for Covid so not everyone who is hospitalized with Covid in Gauteng was in hospital because of Covid.

It’s still early days but this is promising. I’m so sick of this pandemic, I’m really hoping omicron is less bad than delta.

Edit: [Hospitalizations in Gauteng for the omicron wave are running at about half the rate for delta/beta after accounting for lag in hospitalization to new cases. Severe cases are running at 1/3 to 1/6th the rate of delta.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/rfalws/daily_discussion_thread_december_13_2021/hodpi2s/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)

TL;DR Hospitalization rate for omicron is half that for delta. When hospitalized, patients of all ages are discharged 4 days faster. For 60+ age group, average stay is 2-3 days shorter than the younger groups in prior waves."

>Late update: The UK Health Security Agency has been in touch to offer final confirmation as to what Sajid Javid meant when he told MPs earlier that “the current number of daily infections are around 200,000”. **He did mean that it is estimated that 200,000 people are getting infected with the Omicron variant every day.** That is what we thought originally, but we took down the headline on the post (see 4.19pm) after it was suggested he meant something else, and it has taken a while to get clarity from officials. A UKHSA spokesperson said Javid was “referring to the number of new infections today [13 December] based on modelling, not the number who are currently infected”. I have amended the wording in the summary as a result."
12/14/2021 12:22,"Make that *carefully controlled* studies. I’m not sure that a simple fixed effects model is adequate to account for covariates related to population behavior and compliance. The large scale study data is also over a year old, before vaccines were available.

This is more of a political issue which comes down to risk tolerance. While mask mandates and in-person dining restrictions both decrease case growth rates to some extent, no one is seriously suggesting closing down restaurants for in-person dining again due to the well-known economic effects. But many municipalities have no problem implementing mask mandates without fair consideration of the tradeoffs, like for example the mental health of school-age children, but that’s even more difficult to quantify in a scientific way."

If scores of people are getting infected, even with a supposedly milder strain and/or widespread vaccine use, you’re going to get quite a few people needing hospital treatment; the more the virus spreads, the more hospitalizations there are. The greater the number of people hospitalized for covid, the lower quality of care there will be which will equal worse outcomes. Additionally, aside from worse covid outcomes, you’ll have less resources for people needing medical care for things like heart attacks, trauma or preventive screening and/or care (think cancer, etc…). This also means more preventable deaths for things that would normally have better survival rates."

I was specifically talking about weaker economies in developing nations in this case, maybe I should have clarified that. 

But regardless, I think talking about decimation of these economies is indeed warranted. 5% of South africa‘s jobs are directly dependent on tourism (same as AU btw). And if you look at the unemployment rate in SA, you can very clearly see how employment rates plummeted at the start of the pandemic, began to recover and then plummeted again when travel bans were put in place after the detection of Delta in late 2020 (the UK travel ban was only lifted 291 later for example, when Delta had long been the dominant variant everywhere already)

It is clear from the timing of the positive test she was infected in Warsaw, so it is probably spreading there already, just undetected. Maybe Poland doesn't use the type of PCR tests that detect omicron? Might be community spread or she got infected at the airport, but timing suggests it was earlier, so likely community spread."

12/14/2021 11:44,"My son was a passenger in a horrific auto accident last October. It was VW Jetta vs telephone pole. He was sent to shock trauma and the poor kid had to be masked unconscious, with a collar on his neck. We weren’t allowed into the hospital at all at first, but they brought me back when they realized he may not make it. I can’t tell you the fear and anxiety I felt as my child was hurt and alone and not able to understand what happened. 

He did make a decent recovery, but had I not fought for him to come home after the hospital he could have been another nursing home casualty, as people here don’t believe in COVID for the most part, and I wasn’t willing to take the chance. 

This whole ordeal has instituted new rules in my home, my kids are no longer allowed to travel with any friends at all, they either drive themselves or we do. 

I can’t casually get in the car and ride with a friend or anything…I barely trust my husband to drive me, and my poor son won’t ride in a car with anyone but me out of fear. 

We are NOT anxious people by nature, but the trauma of the last 2 years has irrecoverably changed my family. We don’t socialize with most of the rest of our family bc they’re anti-vaxers.

Crazy part of all of this, my Mother died March 2020, and I just hit me YESTERDAY that she’s gone, and the Holidays feel empty…last year we lost my mom, bought a house during COVID restrictions (1/10 do not recommend!) I worked through the pandemic at Starbucks (also 2/10 do not recommend) then my son was hospitalized…2020 was a whirlwind of fear and anxiety and now the jet lag has finally given way to reality and just general sadness. 

At least my husband, myself and our kids are vaccinated and who can be is boosted. 

Fucking hell."

The lines have completely blurred, I'm not at all engaged in my major anymore, hardly bother attending classes, submitting coursework is like pulling teeth, and all the motivation I had in Spring 2020 has completely evaporated. My university is finally going back to in-person next semester, and even then will have a wealth of distancing and masking policies which will depersonalize and deflate the classroom environment. 

The idea that I ever attended lectures and club activities on campus without any precautions seems completely foreign to me now. Literally feels like a distant fuzzy memory that I'm not even sure I ever experienced. It sucks and I harbor a lot of resentment to all of the administrators and health officials responsible."

One guy learned those reviews get taken down so now he just says awful shit about the food in an attempt to hurt the family who owns the restaurant even though he admitted to never eating there in his first (removed) review. What happens if his account gets banned and he comes back under a new username that can't be linked to him? It's silly and unethical to remove every bad review just in case they're him in disguise.

I'd wager a good many people have had asymptomatic cases, even vaxxed. Especially vaxxed, actually, because you can still get covid, you're just much less likely to have severe/any symptoms.

The problem with the public perception of vaccines is that most people believe they are invulnerable and, like you said, go back to their old pre-covid ways. The problem with fixing that misconception is that a good number of people would rather gamble on catching the disease vs near-guaranteed feel ill for a day or two after getting the vaccine."

I think folks got vaxxed and decided to go back to their nasty before-time habits. I was always an avid handwasher pre-covid and still am. I still also practice social distancing in that I get my groceries delivered and I rarely go out to indoor dining especially in the fall/winter when restaurants can’t/won’t ventilate properly. 


Just for the record, I live and work in NYC and commute by train everyday so I’m not some hermit. I also work in a production/manufacturing environment that was considered essential so I was never under lockdown or WFH. I also only ever wear three-ply cloth masks from Old Navy but I have never had Covid-thank God-because I wore my mask every time I left my apartment, without fail, and it always covered my mouth and nose. 

I also go to a gym twice a week and my gym still has social distancing and is under a mandatory vaccination requirement for attendance. 

People have to realize that this is a novel or new disease. Just because you’re vaxxed doesn’t mean you can throw caution to the wind. This virus always finds a way to flip the script on us, so we have to do the first principles-mask wearing, hand-washing, social distancing-and vaccination."
12/14/2021 11:31,"This is great news overall, especially as you said the halving of hospital time, but I think there is a dangerous idea going round that ""mild"" = ""the common cold"" and the world can act as if nothing is happening. Anything that keeps you in hospital for at least 5 days, puts 5.6% of hospital cases into ICU and 20% of hospital cases on supplemental oxygen is not a common cold.

At best it may be on a par with the shittier end of seasonal flu and if it becomes endemic, we have to deal with bad respiratory seasons for years and decades to come, taking tens of thousands of lives but over a much longer time scale as is now the case with 2008 H1N1 Swine Flu.

The higher percentage of people on high care, if there is still the usual progression of people getting steadily sicker and sicker until they need ICU, may be an early sign that ICU admissions will increase."

12/14/2021 11:27,"Don’t you realize that we are NEVER going to “stop” the spread of SARS-CoV-2?  The virus is here, it’s worldwide, and it’s now documented in multiple different animal populations. There is no future where we somehow shift the R0 of this virus through vaccination and public health measures such that we reach some mythical “Covid 0.” We are well on the way towards this novel coronavirus pandemic becoming yet another endemic, seasonal respiratory virus like many of its cousins. 

The most stringent public health measures, mask mandates, quarantines, etc made sense in a time when there were no vaccines and or therapeutics available for a new viral infection with a rapidly growing case rate, a relatively high risk of death and severe illness, and early warning signs of strains on the healthcare system with legitimate concerns for the ability to appropriately care for everyone should the growth rate continue.  This is the whole philosophy behind the “bend the curve” campaign way back in spring 2020. 

Now, however, we live in a very different country where at least 50 million have already been infected, and a large percentage of the population is vaccinated, so policies should change to reflect that."

One thing that can help when someone is overwhelmed is to ground themselves. Can you take a few breaths and identify 3 things you can hear? 3 things you can feel? Can you flex and relax 3 parts of your body, like shoulders, big toes, neck?

Meditating or exercise can be an effective antidote to spiraling thoughts. Yoga with Adrienne on YouTube offers a blend of the two, or a brisk 30 minute walk.

It takes time to ease out of anxious thinking. Repetition of what helps you - meditation or exercise or limiting your media exposure or medication, can weaken those anxious-wired brain cells.

12/14/2021 11:08,"""New Omicron infections in the UK are running at 200,000 a day, dwarfing the number of officially confirmed cases, according to an estimate from the UK Health Security Agency.

The figure, revealed by health secretary Sajid Javid in the House of Commons, added urgency to Boris Johnson’s promise to offer all eligible adults in England a Covid-19 vaccine booster jab by the end of the year.

The total number of Omicron cases, which have been confirmed by genomic sequencing, stood at about 4,700 on Monday after 1,576 new cases were recorded. But the UKHSA estimated the true number of daily infections was far higher based on its modelling.

As the UK recorded its first death from the coronavirus variant, Javid said the NHS had declared Omicron a “national incident”, enabling central co-ordination of the health service’s emergency response. The fast-spreading strain now represents 20 per cent of cases in England, while 10 patients were in hospital after being infected with Omicron, he added.

The NHS will have to distribute 18m booster jabs in England in less than three weeks to meet the prime minister’s target. But NHS leaders expressed doubt about the stretched health service’s ability to meet that goal, which would require it to beat its daily record from March of 756,000 jabs in a single day for the remainder of the year.

12/14/2021 11:08,Even in the UK we don't identify the majority of cases.  And this figure does stack up against other modelling e.g. Zoe. We do not have 200k cases confirmed by PCR.
12/14/2021 11:07,"I came down to SD-TJ from Seattle about a month ago. No one wears masks out in nightlife bars other than staff, and 0 vax checks at the door. Seattle would check photos, mostly only a formality, before I left. Stores have been probably 50/50. 

Recently started hopping over to TJ, and a lot more consitent ~80% masking, a lot of stores and some bars have a thermometer & sanitizer at the door. Although I saw a lot of people using their wrist, not sure how that affects the accuracy, and I doubt it's even halfway decent in ideal circumstances."
12/14/2021 11:07,"You know I'm reading this in Germany where the mask mandate has been around forever (sometimes FFP2=N95) and where only vaccinated or recently recovered people are allowed in non-essential stores and cafés, in many places that's vax+test.  
It feels strange seeing the exact same problem causing such widely different measures."

> ""99 out of every 100 seniors survived theme park ride!""

Hmmm, no. Still seems pretty scary."
12/14/2021 11:01,"i should've known that'd summon anti-vaxxers, despite the studies showing that vaccines are effective at reducing both infection and death.

Since you want to compare the death rates of those two states specifically; I'll use two reference dates, the start of the year (a few weeks after the vaccine was approved, so around when the first people were getting their second dose) and April 20 (when the vaccine became available for all adults in the US) and data from 91-divoc.

Year to date, New York has had 104 deaths per 100,000 people, and from April 20 to now, New York has had 34 deaths per 100,000 people.  
Year to date, Florida has had 187 deaths per 100,000 people, and from April 20 to now, Florida has had 128 deaths per 100,000 people. 

Even over the last two months, New York has had a death rate of 12 per 100,000 people and Florida has had a death rate of 20 per 100,000 people.

And beyond that, to the credit of enough people in Florida, a significant population has still gotten vaccinated; Alabama they aren't. However, just relying on the moral people clearly has a ceiling."

12/16/2021 22:43,"Well, what I’m saying is anecdotal, so take it as such. But I’ve had a whole lot of patients who weren’t admitted for their initial infection at all. You could possibly argue that the infection didn’t cause these new problems, but sometimes, it is just *too* coincidental. When someone is overall very healthy and then develops major health issues, that is a major change that occurred in a short time frame. 

We have a section on our handoff report where we write down medical history to quickly give the oncoming nurses an idea of what a person’s overall health has been like. For lots of these patients, there’s literally nothing significant to write down. Maybe there’s a ‘tonsillectomy’ or ‘appendectomy’ or whatever. Normally, you wouldn’t even write that down, but I guess we do to not just leave the medical history part blank. Why would someone’s kidneys, liver, and lungs all suddenly show compromised function? Why do they now have myocarditis and/or arrhythmias? Why did they get diabetes type I in their 40s or 50s or 60s shortly after that mild Covid infection? Yeah, it could all be a coincidence, but if I were a betting type, I would bet it’s not, because that would be really strange, and when someone is admitted for Covid, their labs show a predictable pattern of organ dysfunction. Meaning that even without the two PCR tests, I could look at lab results and vital signs and tell you that person likely has Covid. Even when we’re getting good gas exchange, the labs are still like that. I’d assume people who have mild symptoms could have the same organ effects. And I don’t want to believe that, frankly, because I had Covid myself. I’ve been putting off my yearly labs, because I am honestly sorta scared to get the results."

12/16/2021 22:42,"*From reporters Lena H. Sun and Frances Stead Sellers:*

Vaccine advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended Thursday that people seeking the safest and most effective vaccines or boosters go with the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna shots, instead of those made by Johnson & Johnson.

In a rare move, the expert panel voted unanimously to advise use of the two mRNA vaccines because of an increased risk of potentially fatal blood clot issues with the Johnson & Johnson shot in a broader cross-section of people than originally reported. Nine deaths — among seven women and two men, ranging in age from 28 to 62 — have been confirmed in connection with the Johnson & Johnson product through September. Officials say there may be two additional deaths but confirmation has been difficult because of lack of complete medical information.

CDC Director Rochelle Walensky will decide later Thursday whether to adopt the panel’s recommendation as agency policy.

12/16/2021 22:42,"The mistake people made in spring was only paying attention to US numbers. The pandemic was still very very bad in many places at that time, and without it being controlled everywhere it was only a matter of time before it came roaring back here.

&#x200B;

Honestly though, even with this Omicron wave we are still in a better position at mitigating its threat to humanity than we were in the spring. Daily deaths worldwide have been holding steady around 7,000 since October, about the lowest it's been since fall last year."
12/16/2021 22:42,"Ok, but real talk if I get Covid and don't go to the hospital, I am pretty thankful that the vaccine reduced that risk by like 90%.  Am I certain I would have gone to the hospital without the vaccine?  No, but still, 90% less likely is really really nice."

12/16/2021 22:42,"I can't help but compare this to my former experience working for an MMO developer for 6 years and then for Zynga during their Farmville/Mafia Wars peak. 

The developers write the code, the code goes to QA, then to a private test server. By the time it's released, there's a list of known issues but for the most part the code should work as expected when it goes live.

But there were times when something went live and blew up despite having passed the QA cycle. You just don't know until it's out there among millions of players. Sometimes a game balance issue would take weeks to be apparent even though it seemed fine on the smaller scale. 

So I'm just waiting for more data and continuing to be really cautious. I know better than to assume that what looks good in the Friends & Family beta is going to be fine when it's finally released."
12/16/2021 22:42,"I don't think that's true though is it?

For starters there are enough people that can't be vaccinated for xyz valid reasons that near 100% isn't really possible anyway.


If you look at countries with high vaccination rates, they still have covid and still have waves. I'm actually surprised nobody has done the maths on this.


Since we know vaccination rates of most countries, and we know vaccine effectiveness, and a lot of countries show how many patients are unvaccinated surely all the data is there to model what hospitalisation numbers would be in a say 95% vaccinated country - if what you say is true, a chart for every country showing hey, here's what life would be like of we all got vaccinated would surely be In everybody's arsenal by now? I mean, what a massively persuasive piece of evidence that would be. The lack of it despite the data existing to make it surely suggests that its not that simple sadly  



I think the key will be, because of exponential growth, the main difference would be more in how long we could DELAY more serious measures.


I mean, the R rate even among the vaccinated if still above 1, means that over a long enough time line, everyone is infected. An entire population at the vaccinated hospitalisation rate is still overwhelming. Even half the population etc.


It would most definitely improve things, but I think we'd still be dealing with covid in much the same ways, just at different times"

12/16/2021 22:36,"That makes no sense. Viruses will in fact eventually stop  replicating if you’re not immunocompromised, even in folks with no prior immunity. If the data holds true the it explains the massive transmission rate and immunity dodging and gives us our first hint at why it appears mild in many cases. The concentration in the nose would also theoretically explain why mild cases are still losing a sense of smell for a shorter period of time. It also explains why natural immunity could be less effective (less memory t-cells than vax) and why it dodges vaccines (and likely even boosters) for infection but not overall outcomes (intramuscular vax are not concentrated in the nose or breathing regions, lungs are in better shape when t-cells start producing massive amounts of antibodies.) 

This isn’t definitively saying it’s mild or not a concern but it does for the first time give us a hypothesis for why outcomes could appear far better in the current data set. I understand that we’ve been conditioned to expect the other shoe to drop but assuming a slower developing virus isn’t good news is a lot more pessimistic than we need to be."

12/16/2021 22:36,".165% death rate amongst all ages. Lots of infections going unreported due so it being milder likely drives that down further. Even with delta the cdc we’re estimating with a 95% certainty that there were 4x the amount of infections and 1.5x the amount of deaths that went unreported in the us.

It looks like it’s getting milder like early reports said so there is a bright, or less dark side depending on your outlook.

12/16/2021 22:27,"Ehh, both sides have merit.

You can argue the same of people taking diabetic meds. It can help them eat more carbs. Hey, they can always go on a higher dose, right? It is under control.

But in reality, the answer is you should reduce your carb intake, exercise, etc. So you can be healthy without more meds.

But that is actually FAR less common. An actual joke doctors talk about is how rare it is for a patient to actually listen to their advice.

Point is, you can go out. Doesn't mean it is a good idea. Doable, sure. Ideal for you and society's medical health nope. 

And at the same time, also not ideal for mental health for many if they don't. But you can say the same for food. Lots of people cope with stress by eating. Doesn't mean there are not other options you can work towards.

Again, both have merit.

One thing is for sure. Bill Gates and many other were 100% correct to be worried about pandemics. Humans can't handle this. Any variety that might pop up, or other virus that is more deadly... It is truly the end of the human race. We just can't handle it properly."

Look at China for an example of what living with 0 covid is like - constant short but extreme lockdowns. One case in your city? Lockdown.


The anti vaxers certainly make the peaks more extreme and the cases larger, but covid wouldn't be gone to a ""we can ignore it"" level even if everyone was vaccinated. 


We just have to live with it, do our best to not catch or spread it, and hopefully that limits the amount of extreme measures anyone has to endure.

I would think the WHO would always be focused on the danger to the population (i.e. WORLD health), not the individual. I guess I should have been more clear about which part of your original comment I was responding to. With WHO being focused on the population, I think it's natural for them to say it's more dangerous.

Now say you have 100k COVID infections at the start which add only 25 extra per cycle, it only a few, nothing like before so what's the big deal?

Well let's say we don't have a lockdown to drop exponential growth because of it. But now you have 500k infected and an extra 125 per cycle for a total of 175. That's 75 people now dying because of a lack of ICU beds above what would normally occur.

A slower burn from limiting spread means that the sickest cases can all be managed better (from a reduce deaths perspective) rather than be overwhelmed.

I'm sure it's inconvenient for some people who are low risk partying, or those losing money, but each person that dies is someone's father, mother, son, daughter, brother, sister or grand parents dying.

And it's not a clean death, it's coughing huge blood clots from your lungs, induced coma, having your intestines explode from impacted shit which then poisons you, organ failure and necrotic tissue eating away and welcome to vegetableville.

I think if you looked at almost all the articles on the omnicron variant, I would guess that maybe 3/4s of them are arguing that the omnicron variant is not less severe or ""mild"". Their was an article yesterday talking about an Ontario public health official saying that the Omnicron variant being more mild is a ""myth"". Obviously this is disingenous at best. Their is evidence that the Omnicron variant is less severe on the average individual thus making this new variant fall within the definition of more mild symptoms than the other variants. But you can always say that even if it is more mild, the exponential growth could be significant and could overwhelm our healthcares even it is as mild as the common cold because it will still have our most vulnerable populations in the hospital. Having a false narrative saying that this variant isn't more mild, mild meaning that has less severe sever symptoms is just misinformation and it can lead to a greater distrust of the public in what experts are saying about the virus. The way this should be treated is that although it is a more mild variant compared to others, the increased infectiousness of this variant could overwhelm our health care systems."

12/16/2021 22:20,"Seems like a pretty safe bet. 4% of cases now with a doubling time of 3 days would mean between 4-5 doublings/12-15 days to be detected as the majority.

This is the same with the flu. Get a flu shot. Still get the flu? Take an antiviral early and you are good to go.

We just are not there yet for covid. But it isn't that far away. If you want to give in and the risk is fine for you, cool. But don't think people being cautious need to be told, ""It is pointless bro give in""."

Hell, you can't even get a representative sample of unemployed people. And in them, there's also one or two people that dominate the discussion. And then you get the massive bias from the people running the damn thing -- because everyone hears what they want to hear.

You can only tell if vaccines ""work"" in when you look at a big enough population (which they clearly do for hospitalization and death)."

Long COVID or Post-acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC): An Overview of Biological Factors That May Contribute to Persistent Symptoms

 I would urge everyone to read it in full.
An excerpt:
> Another team documented persistent COVID-19 symptoms in 1,407 subjects with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (Huang Y. et al., 2021). Symptoms included fatigue and muscle weakness, insomnia, palpitations, chronic rhinitis, dysgeusia, chills, sore throat, and headache. 27% of subjects reported persistent symptoms after 60 days, with patients aged 50 ± 20 years comprising 72% of cases. Women were more likely to report persistent symptoms, and **∼32% of subjects reporting symptoms at 61+ days after infection were asymptomatic** at the time of initial SARS-CoV-2 testing."

It makes no sense to create a systemic immune response and summon armies of immune cells to muscular tissue. It’s fine if this is the best tool we have available right now, but researchers are confident that nasal sprays will become the norm. They induce mucosal immunity in the areas of the body that are actually exposed to viruses, they protect against all variants, and they have almost zero side effects.

The future will be a spritz up the nose maybe twice a year.

12/16/2021 21:58,"Article : 

The various measures that controlled the spread of other variants—masks, better ventilation, contact tracing, quarantine, and restrictions on gatherings—should all theoretically work for Omicron too. But the U.S. has either failed to invest in these tools or has actively made it harder to use them. Republican legislators in at least 26 states have passed laws that curtail the very possibility of quarantines and mask mandates. In September, Alexandra Phelan of Georgetown University told me that when the next variant comes, such measures could create “the worst of all worlds” by “removing emergency actions, without the preventive care that would allow people to protect their own health.” Omicron will test her prediction in the coming weeks."
12/16/2021 21:58,Right there with you all. This shit sucks. I’m tired of doing the right thing for assholes that won’t do it for anyone else.
12/16/2021 21:58,"South Africa doesn’t categorize their deaths by variant, so we have no record of how many deaths there have been caused by any strain, other than by looking at their trends over time and estimating.

12/16/2021 21:58,"Sure,  but it's simple math. 

If it spreads to three times as many people,  but is 50% less dangerous,  then what's that going to do to our hospitals?

People are missing it is basic exponential math,  or they don't seem to understand why we locked down to begin with. 

Millions of people need a booster shot to have any reasonable chance at mitigating damage from omicron... and our population is barely 60% vaccinated at all.  Any type. 

Really bad times are ahead.  If Omicron popped up in September it wouldn't be nearly so bad"
12/16/2021 21:58,"If more people just had this level of common sense the spread wouldn't even be bad.

12/16/2021 21:58,rofl ok
12/16/2021 21:58,Not necessarily. You may just never reach the same effect level regardless of how much you give them. This would follow a sigmoidal dose response curve. It’s possible the Emax (where the effectiveness reaches an asymptote) is just not as high with this variant.

Exercise as a chore is way less likely to succeed than if you find something you really enjoy doing, that also happens to be exercise.  I lost a shit ton of weight rock climbing, and I've been able to keep it off - not because I'm disciplined, but because I like rock climbing.

12/16/2021 21:56,"Kind of, yes. Not necessarily less virulent or contagious, but less deadly.

Selective pressure means mutations to the virus that don't kill its hosts are more likely to survive. But as mutations are somewhat random it doesn't rule out the possibility of deadly or harmful variants entirely. 

Hopefully, however, Omicron is the first step in the endemic phase of SARS-CoV-2 where this thing just gets weaker and weaker from here until its like the common cold virus."

12/16/2021 21:56,"I already was afraid of the flu and the cold before COVID even existed, as a healthy 16 year old. Being sick for 2 weeks is simply outrageously uncomfortable. I opened and open all windows upon entering any closed space like a bus, classroom or room, carried disinfectant and disinfected every surface I would get in frequent close contact with. I always carry Sudafed, acetaminophen, acetylcysteine cough syrup, Breathe Right strips, benzydamine throat spray and oxymetazoline nasal spray to every occasion that I would not have access to our house medicine cupboard, just in case I get a cold.

I am now double vaxxed, yet I still hate the prospect of having an even stronger endemic cold."
12/16/2021 21:56,My office of 70 or so people had 1 case in the last year. This week alone we have 4 cases all who are fully boosted. Pretty sure Omicron is just everywhere at this point and it doesn't give a fuck about the vaccines.

12/16/2021 21:55,"There's no doubt that some messages were too easily misinterpreted. The Jan 14 tweet is probably the best example of that. But my point was that you often get a very different message when you watch the actual press conference/read the full press release rather than getting the info mediated through press outfits. 

A good example is the one from a while ago when Maria VK was talking about the number of asymptomatic carriers. In her answer to a question she explained the difference between asymptomatic and presymptomatic carriers. Of course, the vast majority of reporting I read about that answer didn't make that distinction clear and completely distorted the message. 

I know we don't all have time to go to the source. That is what the media is supposed to do for us. But when it's dealing with a serious matter like this, I think it should be a matter of personal responsibility to read the primary source before repeating information and assessing the quality and consistency of messaging."
12/16/2021 21:55,"There’s probably no point in continuing to engage with you but I think you’re taking the wrong things away from my original statement.  People not wearing masks at work is just a small part of the issue, in fact most people do wear them despite it not being mandated.  I don’t ask people’s vaccination status but I’m sure most of them are vaccinated too, despite not being mandated to be.  The point is that so many of us are expected to be working in person again now (which btw i did my job just as well for 16 months from home) but also being asked to sacrifice the things that make life worth living, like spending quality time with our family and friends.  Either it’s too dangerous to be interacting with people, period or it’s not.  It’s hard not to feel like just a cog in the capitalist machine at this point."

I had ""mild"" symptoms that started with a stomachache, later I started coughing so badly that I was breathless, had conjunctivitis, night sweats, all my joints were hurting, fever, tiredness all the time and finally after four days of the initial symptom I lost the sense of taste and smell. 

Today I'm regaining some senses of taste and smell, but I'm feeling something stinking inside my nose everytime I breath like something died inside it, probably sinusitis that got worse after covid-19.

Its categorically not a baristas job, or the guy behind the counter at the gym to get in fights over SOMETHING ELSE when working those sorts of jobs is already awful.

You asked about my relationship - I've never been in a situation quite like this, after 15 years.

If the R^0 is high enough then the overall milder percentages will still flood the already overly taxed healthcare systems, it won't matter if the individual outcome percentages are milder.

Not just a tiny bit weaker, but *much* less severe, to the point where statistical noise cant even come close to explaining the differences. 

The thing which seems to separate omicron is that its much *quicker*. Incubation period seems to be quicker, and people get sick quicker, and then they recover quicker. It doesn't seem to be able to latch onto the lungs as well, and so it doesn't end up taking root in the body. The theory that it adapted a lot from the common cold coronavirus seems to be holding weight, its basically a mix of the two."

It’s not always 100% because there are always people that think they are above the rules but it’s probably always 95%. I would choose to work for someone that cared for their staff a little better. I was actually at a store in Chester County the other day and there was probably like 90% mask usage (with no mandate) so it sounds to me like you are maybe just going to places that attract people that think they are special. That’s a hard pass for me. Anyway. Good luck “doing your own research”. That’s worked out well for so many people lately."
12/16/2021 21:48,When covid is endemic and not so harsh on the body that people are long haulers or on ventilators in the ICU. I’m guessing it’ll happen within a year or so based on everything ive seen.
12/16/2021 21:48,"> Honestly it seems subjective so it is probably one of those things where we won't know we're there until we get there.

If you allow government expanded power based on subjective criteria, they will simply keep making up more reasons to justify a continuing expansion of power.

Please remember that this all started with ""two weeks to flatten the curve."""
12/16/2021 21:48,"No, the Armageddon is not materializing. I can't believe I have to tell you fear mongerers this."
12/16/2021 21:48,Which means it'll take more of it to have the same treatment if efficiency.  That means fewer doses for even more people.
12/16/2021 21:48,There are a lot of pros and cons to consider with both of these types of vaccines. I think that the CDC panel is definitely considering all of the factors involved before making a recommendation.
12/16/2021 21:48,"Probably won't do great at preventing infection of other variants, but most likey can prevent hospitalization and severe disease. But is still anyone's guess.

New conspiracy time, okay hear me out, make sure all the antivaxxers think this is true so they go get vaccinated: US gov is about to go broke, can't continue money printing without without hyper inflation. Vaccination rates are too low, will fuck with economy. Special team of scientists design a live attenuated vaccine that has a high transmission rate, drop it off in SA's largest city where the virus's closest relative can be found (still way different but they dgaf, no one trusts Africa health agencies anyways). Basically is a forced vaccination of all low risk individuals, of the high risk individuals, some may die, but delta was gonna get them anyway. Pandemic over. Question for antivax now becomes; do you want the CIA mad scientist vaccine or Pfizer?

Edit: a word"
12/16/2021 21:47,"Ah, makes sense. You're probably right that some of them chose to avoid confrontation by just lying.

Anyway, I hope you have a beautiful wedding and a fantastic marriage!"
12/16/2021 21:47,"The messaging is awful because people don't know and they are doing their best to figure complicated data out quickly. What about that is hard for people to understand? You aren't going to get a crystal clear response on this right now. And if the CDC is too upfront about not knowing,  the control freak side of humanity will panic. We are not in control and have to come to terms with that."
12/16/2021 21:47,Unprecedented times.
12/16/2021 21:47,"what is your definition of ""over""?"
12/16/2021 21:47,Hopefully that's true
12/16/2021 21:47,Healthcare too. There will be so many frontline workers off at the time they’re critically needed.
12/16/2021 21:47,Unless it leads to a recombination effort and delta and omicron end up coexisting.
12/16/2021 21:47,"I don't believe there is a specific numerical threshold to defining a pandemic, but looking at the definition (here is one source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic), I would say when we don't have a significant portion of the population around the world affected by COVID any longer, and it moves more to being ""endemic.""

Honestly it seems subjective so it is probably one of those things where we won't know we're there until we get there.  

Take an extreme example - let's say cases dropped to the point where positivity rate was <1% and we had days go by in multiple countries/states/etc. where no one died...I think that would no longer be a pandemic situation.

Again, just my 2 cents, I don't claim to be an expert on this."
12/16/2021 21:47,What would a lot of angry people do? Are you saying that angry people should protest or something? Protest for what exactly?

12/16/2021 21:47,"The booking system is weird. You'll be offered different things at different times of day.

Anyone who's booked a slot in January should check again to see if anything sooner is available. They can do this before cancelling an existing appointment.

There's also plenty of walk-ins, quite a few of which have small queues."

^ What we hope and should know soon."
12/16/2021 21:46,"But that's because of like 100 years of effective inflation. We're looking at a very short timeframe here; there's no distortion via that angle. Your example, could be still done on a linear scale but with % movement, for example. 

For this, I just think this is something that people who work in the space that's used to but people in the public will misinterpret. That's all.

It's not a big deal but there's really something to intuitive visualizations accurately telling the story. To a layman...the original doesn't."
12/16/2021 21:46,"Until yesterday, 23.4% of the total population have been boosted. [Source](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/9824b03b114244348ef0b10f69f490b4/page/page_3/) (Dashboard from/by the DK *Statens Serum Institut*, so in Danish - boosters are called 'revaccination').

As of... 3 days ago, I think it was? anyone 40 or over who got their second shot 4.5 months ago can get boosted. This is about 1.3 million people, which is quite a bit when the total DK population is ~5.8 million.

Right now wait times for boosters (no available timeslots when booking, very long lines at walk-in places) are a problem, but the authorities are calling on GPs, pharmacies, etc, so hopefully that'll smooth out a bit once everything is up and running."
12/16/2021 21:46,"And what can we do? 38% of the population refuses to get vaccinated whatsoever, should we line them all up at gunpoint and force them to get an injection? Should we lock them all in their homes for the next 3 months until this wave goes away? What needed to be done was a countrywide vaccine mandate, and that should have happened 6 months ago.  Anything we do now won't do s***."
12/16/2021 21:46,"This is what I do, and if I go to an event like a concert or something (which I've done several times) I wait a few days and do an at home test. Or if I'm going to see friends with a kid too young to be vaccinated, I do the same. Its different now than it was a year ago. I'm boosted, healthy, and can test myself. Life goes on."
12/16/2021 21:46,"> All indications are that people are still well protected against severe illness with even a double dose.

Actually, no. Only 70% protection against hospitalization with Omicron if you have 2 doses of Pfizer. Considering how insanely quickly Omicron spreads, that is not good enough."
12/16/2021 21:46,True. Thanks for the insight. Feel sorry for all the health care PROFESSIONALS that have to deal with the incoming storm.. again.
12/16/2021 21:46,Sure like a mild case of stubbed toe or a mild case of death. Both mild. Both to an extent different.
12/16/2021 21:45,"Or you know, enough angry people are able to get things done to change the trajectory of the pandemic. But of course, if people aren't already angry enough after 2 years of this shit, then maybe things are kinda hopeless."
12/16/2021 21:45,"If the first person who got sick and developed symptoms tested negative, then wouldn't it be something else?

We don't mind getting tested, but it seemed unlikely it was omicron."
12/16/2021 21:45,I know plenty of his history. Some of us were alive and paying attention during the early AIDS epidemic too. Just because someone doesn't agree with you doesn't mean they are ignorant.

12/16/2021 21:45,Neurological symptoms like loss of smell are no longer common thankfully. Starting with delta I believe.
12/16/2021 21:45,"Hi, only genome sequencing (done in a laboratory) can tell which variant one has. This is done on the sample taken for a PCR test."

12/16/2021 21:45,"I'm from the UK, cases shouldn't matter. Most people have it but have no symptoms because most UK adults have had the jab. We don't care how much the flu spreads because we have a vaccine for that. We don't self isolate to stop it spreading! Even though covid is more deadly we should get on with our lives now that we have a vaccine"
12/16/2021 21:45,"Got my second dose in July and a mild case of covid (probably Delta) in October. When can I get a booster shot, and should I be worrying until then or do I likely have enough immunity against the new variants?"
12/16/2021 21:44,Doubt it was pertussis. I was updated with my TDAP booster as well. I actually remembered googling it that year and I read several news reports of a really bad cold going around with a severe lingering cough. It was interesting.
12/16/2021 21:44,How’d you get a 2nd booster?
12/16/2021 21:44,Subscribe to John Campbell on YouTube for the latest answers to all these questions in the comments. He really is a terrific educator and is watching all the data. What has happened in South Africa is a model for what will be happening here in the next few weeks.

Keep in mind that the vast majority of long covid horror stories are from before the vaccine."
12/16/2021 21:44,Yeah I get the need for restrictions but turning around after and telling me I need to go to work in a crowded food plant 6 days a week still makes me feel pissed off and not want to follow it. I  get works a necessity but at least drop the mandatory overtime or something
12/16/2021 21:44,What percentage of cases in the US are currently Omicron?
12/16/2021 21:44,Even moreso the fact that it’s not very effective against newer strains.
12/16/2021 21:44,How do you know it’s the new variant
12/16/2021 21:44,Yeah there's lots of data already but you need lots of data *over time*. This variant is new and we just don't have enough data over time to draw conclusions. Most people don't understand how they're seeing science unfold in real time. With the world at our fingertips 24/7 we as a civilization are impatient as fuck

12/16/2021 21:43,"Honestly I feel like I almost didn’t get hit as hard mental health wise by all this because of my anxiety and depression. Like my mental health has definitely suffered, but it seems like not nearly as much as many of my friends and family. I’ve been operating at a baseline of “on the verge of spiraling panic and miserable depression” as like a default state since I was about 8 or 9 years old, I’m used to it and have some tools to cope. I feel like some of the people I know who haven’t struggled with it before had kind of a rude awakening when it came to isolation and health anxiety and mass uncertainty than I did. 

It’s weird to think of the ways in which my brain regularly malfunctions as something that has come in handy during a disaster, and it sounds really bleak to describe it this way but I feel like I didn’t have as far to fall since I started pretty close to the bottom relative to my more mentally healthy pals, but in a way I feel like I didn’t spiral as badly because I was already always in the “something bad is happening, brace yourself” mindset."

>The CDC’s guidelines are limited: Isolate if you’ve either tested positive in the past 10 days or are experiencing symptoms, and end your isolation after 10 days only if you’ve gone 24 hours with no fever (without the use of Tylenol or other anti-fever drugs) and your other symptoms are improving—not counting the loss of taste and smell, which could take a couple of weeks to return.

Nowhere in this guidance does it say from symptom onset. Also, if you don't have symptoms does that mean you don't isolate at all? That sounds utterly insane to me."

12/16/2021 21:42,Most cases were vaccine breakthroughs?
12/16/2021 21:42,Most people were vaccinated by the time it hit. It might have been more severe than the early variants but I was fully vaccinated when I got it so only felt down for a couple of days. People who got it back in early 2020 had zero immunity so would have been more severely sick even from a less serious variant.

Of course it's in the back of my mind, but if this variant is as transmissible as they're claiming - it's not a matter of IF, but WHEN. I'm just hoping it doesn't happen during my trip. Lemme have this trip I've been looking forward to."

12/16/2021 21:39,"Nearly every article I read on Omicron these days follows the same pattern: An alarming headline that is in no way supported by what the article actually says. I'm not saying that Omicron won't yet lead to more hospitalizations, but most of the articles I'm seeing haven't established that that's the case.

At this point there does seem to be a preliminary, albeit jumbled, consensus that Omicron does cause milder illness, but that because it is so transmissible, it could still overwhelm healthcare systems with the elderly, the unvaccinated, and the immunocompromised."
12/16/2021 21:39,"So how does that apply to Philadelphia?   I get your point, but there is another point to be made that people “making their own risk assessment” is the reason that we have to have more mandates and rules.

12/16/2021 21:39,I got my booster the first week it was approved for Moderna. Had similar side effects as my 2nd dose but more mild and less duration. Maybe it's because the booster for Moderna is half the dose of the 1st and 2nd dose.
12/16/2021 21:39,I said exactly the same thing until I became sick and had to go to the hospital and even though I wore an N95 and face shield I still caught it while there. We took it so serious and never left the house for months before that. I’m 34/M and was very healthy at the time and I still got long covid that just wrecked me. This is why people should take this more seriously instead of saying if you don’t want to get it just stay home. I have doctors procedures I need done 3 months ago but it’s not safe to do. Many of our elderly have no choice and have to go in for appointments for various reasons and it sounds like if they do they will surely catch this variant with how transmissible it is.

12/16/2021 21:38,"Your analysis doesn't seem based off of an understanding of pathological mutation and natural selection pressures, it seems like you've just played too much plague inc. ."
12/16/2021 21:38,"No, I'm the resentful crowd, as in fuck anyone who is comfortable with living with this needless death and suffering humming in the background."
12/16/2021 21:38,Yes. The UK and Israel are giving boosters at 3 months.
12/16/2021 21:38,How you feeling?
12/16/2021 21:38,">History suggests that the end of the pandemic will not simply follow the attainment of herd immunity or an official declaration, but rather it will occur gradually and unevenly as societies cease to be all consumed by the pandemic’s shocking metrics. Pandemic ending is more of a question of lived experience, and thus is more of a sociological phenomenon than a biological one. And thus dashboards—which do not measure mental health, educational impact, and the denial of close social bonds—are not the tool that will tell us when the pandemic will end. Indeed, considering how societies have come to use dashboards, they may be a tool that helps prevent a return to normal. Pandemics—at least respiratory viral pandemics—simply do not end in a manner amenable to being displayed on dashboards. Far from a dramatic “end,” pandemics gradually fade as society adjusts to living with the new disease agent and social life returns to normal.

>As an extraordinary period in which social life was upturned, the covid-19 pandemic will be over when we turn off our screens and decide that other issues are once again worthy of our attention. Unlike its beginning, the end of the pandemic will not be televised."
12/16/2021 21:38,Nothing unfavorable about a virus that is now milder.
12/16/2021 21:38,"Ah, okay. I'm not sure. There is some indication that the first epicenter (Gauteng) is already seeing a decline in new cases. It's still a bit too early to tell."
12/16/2021 21:38,This is the same company that permanently closed down stores in Seattle last year rather than pay employees their required covid hazard pay. Folks may want to think twice about supporting them.
12/16/2021 21:38,"It makes sense since a lot of vaccines are for multiple things at once. Even the flu vaccine is usually for three different strains.

I had side effects from getting both, but less than the  second dose of Pfizer. Both arms were definitely sore which always happens to me from shots. Of course it didn’t register to me beforehand that they’d put one in each arm. I still wouldn’t hesitate to do it again."

12/16/2021 21:37,"You're correct, not sure why people knee-jerk down voted. Coinfection with multiple variants isn't required for mutations to occur though. They happen spontaneously all the time but rarely persist. 

The HIV/AIDS patient origin is just a hypothesis as far as I know, but it's plausible. I'm skeptical personally - immunocompromised hosts are more likely to produce less successful variants, not more. It could happen, but it would be by random chance. 

If it did recombine with the common cold, I don't know how being immunocompromised would make that any more likely to occur. There very well could be a reason, I just haven't seen anything mentioned."

12/16/2021 21:35,Could be. Until Omicron there wasn't really a push to get younger people boosted so they weren't needed. I know in my province they JUST expanded the boosters to 18 plus a few days ago (it was 70 plus before that). We had a lot of people get second doses in July/early August who are just reaching their 6 month mark now and there are no appointments available. My mom is 86 and her booster appointment isn't until January 13.
12/16/2021 21:35,Omicron Variant? Never heard of it. I'll stick to my current provider.
12/16/2021 21:35,"THis is the original report the guy was quoting from:

https://www.discovery.co.za/corporate/news-room

The bottom line:

about 30% less severe as far as hospitalizations go, whether you are vaccinated, recovered or naive.

about 1/10 as severe as far as deaths.

For unvaccinated...

23% protection from reinfection if you had the original strain;

40% protection  from reinfection if you had the Beta variant;

60% protection  from reinfection if you had the Delta variant.

And much higher protection if you were infected and also vaccinated.

They agree that boosters protect pretty well.

.

So there's some conflicting opinion about whether or not it is less severe for the unvaccinated and naive, but relatively few in South Africa are completely without some protection due to the high rate of infection already, so that's not surprising."
12/16/2021 21:35,"True, the positivity rate is the real key, 30+% on average.

I think the real key is in the hospitalizations, for example, how many more patients can Guateng handle? 

They currently have 3,100 in there, 90 on ventilators, 564 being oxyginated.

Also, given that the first month of Omicron data is showing that fewer people are being hospitalized, the ones who are, are staying for fewer days (on average 3 vs 8 for Delta), and fewer hospitalized patients needs O2 and vents which implies far less utilization of ICU resources.  It would take an absolutely amazing wave of cases to overrun the hospitals at this point and the UK is nowhere close to that point at the moment."

It's being encouraged everywhere. I normally wouldn't get Two vaccines in one day, and the funny thing is I don't even know why. I just had this knee jerk reaction to the idea that folded when I thought about it for a bit. 

Got the Pfizer booster (after 2 dose Moderna) and this years Flu shot at the same time, one in each arm. I had almost Zero next day 'hangover' and barely any injection site pain (which might be down to the skill of the person giving the shots). 

Omicron is here. Unless anybody can predict when they'll come across it, because odds are extremely high that they will, the best action to take is to get them both - ASAP -. 

It could mean the difference between needing hospitalization and not. The hospitals need any breaks they can get. Let's try to give it to them."
12/16/2021 21:33,"Firstly, there are a lot of people, vaccinated and unvaccinated, that don’t think vaccinated people should be changing their behavior to protect the unvaccinated. 

I think it is a slippery slope to make someone’s medical treatment dependent upon whether they took the necessary prevention steps. We do already do this to some extent - I believe, in most situations, smokers have higher health insurance costs, but one could easily imagine a world where obese people are treated similarly. I don’t think these discussions should be taboo, but we should remember that we’re talking about human beings here.

12/16/2021 21:31,"To me, this is the most telling sampling of data as far as indicating the seriousness of the current situation. There is no speculation, and there is no reliance on a number of people voluntarily getting themselves tested. This is a relative measurement of covid in waste. The times where the waste line greatly exceeds the testing line is where there was severe undertesting relative to the actual number of cases occurring daily. When looking at just the northeast, it's easy to see the massive amount of covid early on, before testing was as widespread as it is today. The fact that it is occurring again now is indicative of how unprepared and complacent everyone has gotten in reaction to this new extra contagious strain. I think the level of spread will become much more apparent next week, at which point safeguards will begin to become less and less effective."

Sure a strain might mutate that kills you dead instantly, but its gonna stop at 1 guy lol.

And recent studies on omicron show that its 70x more prevelant in bronchial tissue, but 10x **LESS**  prevalent in lung tissues.

Upper respriatory infection means bad cough, lower respriatory infection means pneumonia. So this is a good thing. 

Meaning, the virus made a major optomization for transmissibility and traded off lethality in the process."
12/16/2021 21:31,"I arrive at a similar conclusion as you, but from different reasoning.

> People don't have real choices.

That's true--and of course, there's no plausible mechanism by which people could even have true free will. But the *illusion* of choice and agency is very real and very valuable. People should be free to do things unless there's a compelling reason to prevent that.

> And the right to make stupid choices is just daft.

No, making *stupid* choices is a major way that people learn and better their lives. Making *murderous* choices (like being willfully unvaccinated) is where we draw the line.

> Like Americans obsessed with the idea of forcing people to have health insurance

Most rich countries do that. They do it more seamlessly than the US does, but many countries (like I think Germany) actually have explicit requirements to choose an insurance plan.

> If you choose to not be vaccinated, rather than cannot for some reason, you are not making a choice, you're intentionally being obstructive for no benefit.

This is the key. It's not so much that freedom isn't *real*, it's more that it's not unlimited. Freedom always, by definition, has limits."

12/16/2021 21:16,"I think it may depend on how you book. I'm from Manchester and booked through the NHS site earlier in the week and was only able to get an appointment in Jan, but I got a text from my GP yesterday and was able to book through their system for this week."
12/16/2021 21:16,Yes I am aware. which is why I said I hope it stays that way (in the future.)
12/16/2021 21:16,"Not everyone can/will get a booster fast enough. So far it's something like 10% of Ontarians. And remember that every new booster takes about two weeks(?) to take full effect. With Omicron spreading so quickly, it will infect a *lot* of people before they're fully protected by their third dose. 

Here's the [update on Covid-19 projections](https://covid19-sciencetable.ca/sciencebrief/update-on-covid-19-projections-15/) that Adalsteinn Brown presented today. You can see they've also modelled ICU occupancy. Worst case scenario, it's nearly 500 and rising rapidly by Dec 31. 

Case numbers will never stop being relevant until this virus is endemic. We should take care to interpret case numbers in the context of vaccinations and predicted disease severity, but cases will remain the critical leading indicator. That doesn't mean that 10,000 cases on Dec 31 2021 will be as bad as 10,000 cases would've been on Dec 31 2020. In that regard, we are in better shape, but we can't let that fool us into thinking that a huge rise in cases is not a problem."
12/16/2021 21:16,"Case numbers absolutely will. No question.

The question is how many of those cases will translate to hospitalizations."
12/16/2021 21:16,"ALSO: On the Deaths section chart, on day 40 we should get a better idea if Omicron appears to be pacing with Beta and Delta."
12/16/2021 21:15,"I'm think it's going to just keep ravaging through the unvaccinated for years to come, if indeed there comes a situation where we need to actually have a yearly vaccine. It will take some time to normalize and balance out, but that doesn't bode well for the denier set."
12/16/2021 21:15,Maybe if they read the piece they would get a sense of how and why people feel hopeless and think of ways of leading us out of it. Nobody wants to hear keep calm and carry on. Even among the most diligent of those taking precautions people are burnt out and tired with no end in sight.
12/16/2021 21:15,"How is everyone with Omicron feeling though? Are the symptoms worse, better?"
12/16/2021 21:15,I'm not sure if those fit under the technical definition.
12/16/2021 21:15,Idiocy run its course more like.
12/16/2021 21:15,"Agreed, and at this point I'm placing blame squarely on anti-vaxxers and pro-Covid politicians. We could be done this by now, we could have been done months ago."
12/16/2021 21:15,"If you follow medical literature, you know that even with these points, the vast majority of people
Who’ve been vaccinated will be absolutely fine with COVID. Stop fear mongering."
12/16/2021 21:15,"I believe in freedom. That's why I support sensible restrictions on those who, by being willfully unvaxxed, are infringing on other's freedom to live.

I believe in personal responsibility. That's why I use proven measures, like masks and vaccines, to do my part.

I believe in patriotism. That's why I'm happy to make small sacrifices for the greater good. (And they *are* small. Previous generations went off to war; I'm just asked to wear a piece of cloth and get some shots.)"
12/16/2021 21:15,"I remember the"" light at the end of the tunnel"", like, one year ago.  It's a fucking long tunnel"
12/16/2021 21:15,I am not an expert but there is more too it than antibody levels
12/16/2021 21:14,What chart are you looking at? Deaths in South Africa from Covid haven’t even slightly increased in the past weeks…
12/16/2021 21:14,"I agree, sadly. I don't think anything short of a variant with MERS level fatality rate would make any difference at this point. The only reason that would make a difference is because workers would be dying too fast for the owner class to get richer."

Since the start of my second tenure as Surgeon General in March, I have been part of the team leading our nation’s health efforts through the COVID pandemic. I'm currently focused on increasing vaccination and booster rates among parents and children, and giving people the latest information on changes that affect them, like the Omicron variant and new COVID treatments.

Separately, I'm working to bring attention to, and develop solutions for, protecting mental health in young people, combating misinformation, and clinician well-being. This year, I've put out two Surgeon General's Advisories, on misinformation and youth mental health.

During my previous tenure as 19th Surgeon General, under President Obama, I created programs for health challenges like Ebola and Zika outbreaks, the opioid crisis, and the growing threat of stress and loneliness to Americans' physical and mental wellbeing. Prior to my role as Surgeon General, I co-founded VISIONS, a global HIV/AIDS education organization; the Swasthya Project, a rural health partnership in South India; TrialNetworks, a technology company dedicated to improving clinical trials; and Doctors for America, a nonprofit mobilizing physicians and medical students to improve access to affordable care. My scientific research has focused on vaccine development and the participation of women and minorities in clinical trials.

12/18/2021 14:27,"While I am fine with getting all the booster shots I can, a monthly shot would be hard - having now received my third dose and having similar experiences after both my second and my third dose, I can make a fair assumption that each shot will be at least as bad, if not worse (third was in some ways worse than second). I was out of commission (high fever and horrible pain) for 48 hours after both my second and my third shot and only now, 5 days after my third shot, I am starting to feel as ok as before. This means that with a monthly shot I would essentially be losing almost 1/4 of each month to the vaccine. I mean, I'd do it in a heartbeat if it meant not dying or not having long-term consequences of contracting SARS-CoV-2 etc but that's a hard prospect... I hope that we will find out that the optimal dosage is spaced at least 3 months or so."
12/18/2021 14:26,For Moderna it’s 100mcg.  For Pfizer it’s 30mcg.
12/18/2021 14:26,"The life boat only holds so many people. We should let all the people on. Even the ones that poked holes in the last life boat and sunk it. Ok now we have too many people on the life boat, we are over capacity, but it hasn’t sunk yet so let’s keep letting people on.

And hope for the best.

Imagine spending all this time working at a hospital and now you get sick. Your in a hospital bed and just got told you can’t have mono colonel antibodies but that guy that just came in with the list of commodities and took the time to decide not to get vaccinated will get better treatment than you."

12/18/2021 14:24,"This is laughable. They tried this something similar not long ago in Vietnam, where I live, with delta and gave up after…3 days. This was with a very compliant and mostly terrified population. 

People who think this would work have no idea how infrastructure and meeting peoples’ basic needs works. 

Also, you aren’t speaking in good faith and you’re using ridiculous hyperbole. No wonder you continue to be downvoted."
12/18/2021 14:24,Agree with this. Just bc you are vaccinated does not mean you are immune and even those that are vaccinated can still spread the virus. Take the necessary precautions. I am sorry for your loss.
12/18/2021 14:23,They're incentivising being unvaccinated. It's insane.
12/18/2021 14:23,"The recirculation argument never made sense to me. We banned smoking on flights because smoke lingers and stinks (and happens to be bad for people). I have only been on a tiny handful of smoking flights in my life, when I was younger, but I remember smoke filling the cabin, and it being especially bad when someone on your row is smoking.

And let's be honest: I've smelled other people's farts on airplanes. That already tells me that the air replacement isn't as good as the typical outdoor space.

So I've always felt that the benefits of the airplane air systems have been overstated for covid risk."
12/18/2021 14:23,"Weird how you conveniently ignored the Bush appointed conservative judge that made this a 2-1 ruling.

12/18/2021 14:22,3M Aura has been comfortable enough for me! More comfortable than a cloth mask and doesn’t fog my glasses. I’ve worn one every day of school this year. But yes many of the N95 masks are very uncomfortable to wear for long periods.
12/18/2021 14:22,"The South Africa (lack of) apparent hospitalizations is interesting. I heard several reasons for why it might be the case unique to South Africa and how that won’t apply elsewhere. I find those reasons fairly dubious at this point in time but the reality is all we can do is wait and see. If the UK’s hospitalizations begin to catapult, well know just how fucked we are. (Although, did they predominantly use AZ vax) Until then, get your booster, wear a face mask and social distance."
12/18/2021 14:22,"Droplets are a huge vector that i don't think you're properly respecting, but you're right that aerosols are devastating as well. 

One possible explanation of seemingly increased infectiousness is that the virus has become more polar, and sits closer to the center of droplets and aerosols, thus not drying out as fast. Aerosols are theoretically more dangerous, because they are more likely to go deep into the lungs.

In a plane, n95s, kn95s, and kf94s should be mandatory. At the beginning if this pandemic the governments should have nationalized ppe manufacture and used the postal service to deliver proper masks to every citizen. Some wouldn't wear them, but many would, and even if they ran out would have come to appreciate such masks as the default.

The last thing I'll say about planes is the air circulation system only works properly once the planes engines are engaged. If you're sitting on the runway, you're not getting much benefit.

This whole any mask will do you bullshit is starting to pay dividends to the virus."
12/18/2021 14:21,"My nephew just turned 9 months today and I'm supposed to go see him and my sister for Christmas Day, but I'm a bartender in South Florida and I've seen three masks in the last three weeks.

I already plan on taking a test before I head up to her place and plan on wearing a mask the entire first day and taking another test the next morning before I feel remotely comfortable around my nephew despite just getting my booster on Monday.

But if this time next week shit's so bad down here that she says, ""I don't feel comfortable."" as much as it would suck I would totally understand.

I remember when this shit all first started popping off in 2020, at one point literally one of the most dangerous jobs to have was being a bartender in South Florida.

That's an odd thing to have happen to you after 11 years in the biz."
12/18/2021 14:21,The only way for this to work is to have a vaccine that has less intense side effects and no severe reactions like myocarditis/clots. Novavax shows promise and hopefully is approved in the US very soon.
12/18/2021 14:20,I last flew in November.  Snacks and alcohol were not being sold.  (American & Southwest Airlines)
12/18/2021 14:20,"There isn’t, but Delta admits are falling some while Omicron is surging. It is everyone’s hope that This will at least spell the end for the Delta wave."
12/18/2021 14:20,"
2-dose vaccination reduces omicron infection by 20% and hospitalization by close to the 90% it gives for Delta. 3 dose vaccination is supposed to do better at preventing infection,  but it for sure does a bit at the other too. 

Over-50 unvaccinated IFR is really disturbingly high.  Even vaccinated over-50 breakthrough IFR is around 1% with Delta. If your parents recover without any long term effects vaccination has succeeded. 

(Source for everything; UKHSA. Numbers are incredibly uncertain for Omicron and may change tomorrow if we find out new things.)"

12/18/2021 14:20,"Lol. It's summer in SA. That doesn't seem to have slowed down the spread there in the slightest.

12/18/2021 14:18,"I live in SA and I’m comfortable saying that you cannot accept any of the statistical conclusions based on SA data. Too many unobservables factors: politics, townships and age distributions. I’m in the same postalcode as Alexandra where there are roughly 600k people living in 1 km2, where we live it’s more 5000 per km2. They just add the figures and tell me that spread is exactly the same within these suburbs. It’s a joke."
12/18/2021 14:17,"Yeah don’t think it’s wise to assertively call it ‘mild’ yet, for the reason you state"
12/18/2021 14:17,It's still a fact that here we have over 80% vaccinated yet in hospitals +/-50% is unvaccinated. It's still a completely disproportionate drain of resources from the unvaxxed that we all have to pay for (literally in healthcare cost but also emotionally because we need lockdowns much sooner to relieve healthcare).
12/18/2021 14:17,"I don't know that these measures will do a whole lot if enacted now, considering recent news of over 80% of cases in London already Omicron; by the time something like this is voted on and implemented, UK may already end up reaching its peak. Keep in mind that with the speed of this the case peaks will arise very quickly, but also will come down quickly due to lack of expansion opportunities locally once a given population is already impacted \[we're seeing that daily with Gauteng\]."
12/18/2021 14:17,This is my point. Some reporting one thing and another something else.these publications publish opinion pieces at this point

FYI He is not even remotely qualified to be giving out information regarding viruses and vaccines. He is a nurse so don't take what he says as gospel. My wife is an immunologist doing research in one of the best labs in the US and even she can never give me certain answers regarding the virus and its mutations."
12/18/2021 14:15,Yeah I keep hearing about immunity but I thought I had read previous infections don’t protect against Omicron. Of course this is fluid and we’re still learning but so many comments here regarding previous immunity as if that’s a certainty
12/18/2021 14:15,"I have not read anything to indicate that Omicron is a significant threat for children and mostly only causes mild symptoms for adults. As for the Delta - that one is a doozy (I had it) but my 8 and 11 year old kiddos also had it, had a slight fever - sneezed once, and literally had no other symptoms. Sending prayers your way.

Edited to add: did your 5 year old have any side-effects from the vaccine? I am truly interested."
12/18/2021 14:15,The excess deaths being already .5% of their entire population would have me leaning towards  “Covid has already killed off their [most vulnerable](https://twitter.com/dfisman/status/1471922667104133125?s=21)”.
12/18/2021 14:15,Get Moderna or Pfizer if you can.
12/18/2021 14:14,"Not everyone was as blessed as you are. Many of us, especially here in the U.S., have anti-vax family members. Others recently had babies who cannot yet be vaccinated. And then there are those who are immuno-compromised, for whom the vaccine provides very little comfort to go out into the world with people again.

Sure, it may be easy to say “just cut the anti-vaxxers out of your life, but that’s hard when it’s you mom, or your sister, brother, father, or other close family. And what do you do if it’s a whole half of your family? Do we just cut them all out and disown them?

Not to mention that outside of Covid, this has been the worst RSV season on record in some time, so taking an infant *anywhere* is a game of Russian Roulette.

What I am saying is that due to many reasons, it’s entirely possible for folks to have gone two years without seeing family members. Some I haven’t seen since 2019 just due to timing prior to the pandemic. It may be easy to judge someone when you don’t know the whole story, but it show bigger character when you are willing to ask and listen without being snarky about it."
12/18/2021 14:13,"Could it be because the population has develpped some form of natural immunity due to the Delta surge several months ago? I""m noticing a similar trend in countries that were hit hard by the Delta variant in the last few months (India, Indonesia, Japan, Philippines, etc.)

My country (Philippines) just got out of its Delta wave (August-September) and our active cases are at the lowest it's ever been since May 2020. We're now just seeing 200-400 new cases a day, from 30,000+ cases a few months ago. Positivity rate is also at less than 1%."
12/18/2021 14:13,"Between March 2020 and June 2021, SA reported 58,702 COVID deaths, their excess deaths (deaths above the yearly average) was 171,000.

That would suggest that SA are substantially under  reporting COVID deaths."
12/18/2021 14:13,Probably it will first become much more expensive (offering better benefits so more people (re)join/stay). But it's practically already too late at that point and this might also structurally screw over cost after the pandemic ends.
12/18/2021 14:13,"Long covid isn't just the lungs.  This is where the main stream isn't looking at the actual data.  Long covid can wreck every organ in your body, damage your blood vessels, eyes, brain, heart, kidneys and liver.   No one knows the mechanisms behind it but it completely ruined my life and I was a extremely fit and happy man.   I'd rather have lung issues then the neuropathy and circulation issues I'm suffering with that are destroying my body"
12/18/2021 14:13,"I want to hear the opposite! I want to see the unvaccinated throng to vaccination centers knowing that if they don’t, if they get Covid, they’re at the back of the damn line. 

And they will get Covid, because Omicron is like a flame thrower in a tinder dry forest."
12/18/2021 14:12,"The study they reference basically says there's not enough hospital data to be sure, but data that is available does not currently suggest a less severe variant.

Also important to remember that Omicron has some fucky mutations that appear to be unrelated to its virality. No word on when that will mutate back to the more efficient mutation, but if/when it does. The key thing here is that nobody knows when this mutation will happen. 

So if we go out and call it mild pre-emptively and then the mutation takes place, people are going to be in a false sense of security and it'll be too late. It's important to treat this variant with the respect it deserves, especially when it comes to protecting ourselves, our families and our communities."

12/18/2021 14:12,"There are a lot of variables at play. Mask wearing, general lock downs, population age. To say there are only a handful now is to eat your words a week or two later. Of course, you could live on an island in the West Indies"
12/18/2021 14:11,"You are thinking like it’s binary - virus in air or no virus in air.

You need to think of it like water getting into a boat on the ocean filled with your family and everything you love. There is definitely going to be water that splashes into your boat. But you still want to make sure things are as water tight as you can make them, where you can. 

If a big wave comes a splashes more than the normal few drops, but you’ve kept everything as dry as possible, you don’t worry too much. The chances of your important items getting wet is low. But these anti maskers have decided they can swim, and their clothes will be ok if they get wet and that’s all they care about, so fuck it, why worry about the water at all?"
12/18/2021 14:11,What if you're flying over the north pole? It would be awfully cold.
12/18/2021 14:11,"Your math appears correct, but leaves out two real-world factors: diminishing returns on new infections, and behavioral changes 

The current doubling rate is based on a population that is 70-80% effectively susceptible to infections. As more get infected, that share reduces, and so the rate of growth will naturally decline (see SIR models) 

Additionally, as cases grow and perception of risk increases, people adjust their behavior, which also lowers effective rate of transmission 

We’re already seeing this play out in South Africa, where infections look to be close to peaking. May find Omicron waves shoot up much faster, but also peak in a much shorter amount of time, along with a lower rate of severe outcomes"

12/18/2021 14:08,"Delta takes 10 days to double. 10 days to go from 1,000 cases to 2,000 cases. If Omicron is taking 2 days to double, that's not 5x more infections in 10 days, it's **32 times** as many infections in 10 days: from 1,000 cases to 32,000 cases. Omicron would need to be *significantly* less severe than Delta in order to not cripple the healthcare system of any country.

Are hospitalizations going up with omicron variant or with delta?"

You will probably get an omicron spike, and if you're in a big city you may not know until the day it starts.  But when that happens _you_ need to make sure someone over 50/60/70 does not catch it."

Whether right or wrong, I just couldn't keep her cooped up in the house any longer. At this age they're really starting to explore and understand the world much better and with the vaccine being too far away I had accepted the risks of covid to let her go that. 

I look at it this way... We don't lock up our kids for seasonal flu which is more severe for young kids, this is just another risk to accept to live as part of society."

My wife’s ultimate goal is to keep the kids away from it as best we can until they can be vaccinated. I’m less worried about that, but I know she’s very concerned despite the numbers with young kids being great.

The virus only has to traverse the relatively wide windpipe, throat and nose/ mouth to reach the outside world instead of a winding labyrinth of tight bronchi as well. I'm sure there are other factors at play that I have no knowledge of as well but the human body somehow evolving to spread viruses from less vulnerable parts of the body isn't one of them."

This has been a four-month long slog of mitigation to reach a high enough vaccination+infection rate that it finally started declining,  and since then we've kept giving a vaccination dose to 1/1500 of the population per day.  Delta is declining.  The is over; we defeated it on November 11 when we started giving out boosters to everyone.  With our high rate of boosters and recent infection *and* rapid rate of decline without many NPIs,  there is no state in the US in better shape at this point in time. 

If Omicron actually passed 500 cases a day today to make a dent in that decline, then with a three day doubling rate (incredibly conservative) we're around 10 days from our highest case count of the pandemic."
12/18/2021 13:49,"New here, and I don’t know how to search for past posts on this specific forum, so my apologies, this is probably a repeat comment/question. Also apologies for the long post. Feel free to downvote and/or just ignore.

From what I have read recently, there have been a few studies that show the vaccine does not significantly help stop the transmission of this virus. So what is the benefit of getting my children vaccinated? I am fully vaccinated btw, and me and my kids already had Corona. They literally sneezed once and that was it for them. I just don’t know how I can gamble with the unknowns of this vaccine on my kids. It was hard enough for me to make the decision for myself to get it, and when it comes to my kids, it a billion times harder. I should also mention, I lost a baby to an extremely rare genetic disorder, so I have already been hit by lightning once. Knowing the side effects of the vaccine are rare doesn’t negate my fears, and none of us truly know if there will be any long-term side effects, which is something else I really worry about. 

Here is one study I found (not peer-reviewed) that seems to show getting vaccinated only slightly lowers the transmission rate, and after 12 weeks, it goes back to the same level of transmission as those that are unvaccinated.

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.28.21264260v2

This one found the transmission rates between the vaccinated and unvaccinated were virtually the same (Delta variant specific):

https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(21)00648-4/fulltext

I know earlier studies seemed to show the vaccine would help reduce transmission, but I think the Delta variant blew all those studies out of the water. Please post others if you know of any.

I live in CA, and the fact that our Governor has mandated all kids 5-12 get fully vaccinated in order to continue attending school in-person really bothers me. Our school district has not acted on the mandate, but Los Angeles tried and ended up pushing the deadline back to next Fall 2022 because so many parents did not want to vaccinate their kids. If it comes down to it, and we have to make a choice between virtual learning and in-school instruction, I will probably, very unwillingly, get them vaccinated. I will never put them through staying home and being away from their friends and not experiencing life again. But being forced to give my kids a vaccine that is so new, does not provide them with any real health benefits, and may not even help stop the spread - as a parent, this just doesn’t sit well with me, and my protective mama bear instincts want to punch Newsom in the face (he hasn’t even vaccinated his own daughter yet and is making excuses for it.)

Thanks for any info. I’d really appreciate if there are any parents out there willing to provide your thoughts and opinions as well."

Moreover, Hong Kong is a big hub in Asia and if they remain cut off from the world, they risk losing this status, hence his concern."

I took some medicine to lower my fever which should start working any moment now.

This is just small side effects that can be easily managed if you're either working from home or get the shot on a Friday, so the side effects occur in the weekend while you're at home.

I'm happy to take these side effects for a day or two if it boosts my immunity against Covid and it's just a small annoyance for few days. While Covid could actually kill you.

I've got some other underlying medical conditions so the vaccine or the booster shot likely increases my side effects like fever and such. 10 people in my family got their booster shots and barely noticed a thing at all.

Delta hospitalised 6% of infected over 65's in the UK. Even if omicron is 50% less virulent, with a doubling time of circa 2 days the whole of the UK will be exposed within 3-4 weeks.

3% of infected 65 years olds hospitalised during that time period will be a problem for our health service. Add to that the thousands of workers who will be having to isolate and I'm sure that you can see for yourself some of the problems a wave like that would cause.

12/18/2021 13:21,"6 months for under 65's where I live. When I was waiting for my second dose back in July, Delta was just starting to take over and people were saying 1 dose is not enough.

12/18/2021 13:14,"OK, well, I'm not treating this guy as my main source of information.

We aren't in the same situation as last year. We're in a different situation — not a good one, but not the same one. You're totally correct in saying that a major problem is those who will not take the vaccine. I am about the most pro-vaccination person you will find on here. I would be happy to take more measures against those who are opposed to vaccination, including requiring the vaccine for treatment in this case. I agree that many countries have done far too much for the anti-vaxxers. Well, you know well that these morons are doing a lot to hold us back. A vaccine should really be mandatory to do most things in life, in my opinion. I am also of the mind that generally mandates to vaccinate are reasonable tools. What the Austrians have announced is a good idea, except that their fine mechanism isn't going far enough (in my opinion). Unfortunately, many people have have gotten dangerous ideas about vaccines being bad into their heads. It's infuriating.

They are already adjusting the spike profile. You know that the EU already has ordered new vaccines with adjusted spike profiles. My desire is that we get those to people as soon as possible. A combination of omicron-lineage and wild-type vaccination should give good immunity against both major categories of strain currently out there. I also do not think we should wait at all to start giving people these vaccines once they are manufactured.

We waited too long to begin the campaign for the original vaccines, when a good stage 2 result really should have led to a ramping up and the general availability to join optionally alongside stage 3 participants. The good news is that the modified mRNA vaccine should be the same in terms of safety, so we should not test it again in stages. Let's get people vaccinated against new strains, let's get people *vaccinated* and not unvaccinated, let's vaccinate kids and let's get through this winter."
12/18/2021 13:13,"And yet only one death with omicron. 

Total UK deaths are less than 100 per day with reported cases 4x higher than the table above. 

People would rather look at made up statistics in an excel table than look outside at the actual real world."
12/18/2021 13:13,Pooh-bear would throw a hissy no doubt lmao.

12/18/2021 13:10,"But let’s be real - the vaccine is not doing that.  We were told vaccines would lift restrictions, we could stop looking at case counts, etc.  It’s not happening.  We’re still being held hostage by looking at case counts and the never ending threat of lockdowns and restrictions.  If we’re still doing that, then it is true - the vaccines do not help people get back to normal life at a societal level.  And I have all the vaccinations I can get.  We need to demand smarter and clearer objectives from government."

12/18/2021 13:07,The problem is that the argument doesn't make any sense. Cardiovascular diseases and cancers both killed over 20 times more people in Finland than Covid did. Assuming they're getting treated why is Covid causing such a chaos in the hospitals.
12/18/2021 13:07,"In Colorado, we had no indication of Omicron through yesterday.  With 20-25% of the population boosted and a really, really high rate of recent infection with declining current infection we're about as well off as anyone to deal with it. Except for the part where hospitals are already 90% full.

Today the -25% weekly case decline had a hint of a +500% weekly growth.  We do not have cases released over the weekend, so we'll see on Monday if cases have grown 2-3 fold.

Moreover, we have so much more than last year, yet we end up in the same bullshit situation, mostly of people not vaccinating themselves. I am calling for not treating those who don't wanna take the smallest step towards 'ameliorating the situation'. 

I am also calling for adjusting the spike profile and not bullshitting folks with having to take the same old vaccine every day. The current ones have been clearly proven having weakened efficacies."

12/18/2021 13:00,Thank you!  That’s very encouraging.
12/18/2021 13:00,"Where we are now is that most of the population is going to catch Omicron over the next 1-3 weeks.  In that context we're past the ""reach out and get boosters to everyone"" point (that was last month and I was 100% on that bandwagon) and on to the ""hide or boost your grandparents"" point.

It's not a great place to be, but we have to work with it.  Rather than worrying about who gets vaccine doses, we're at the ""literally bring food to anyone old you know so that they don't catch it in the next two weeks"" phase."
12/18/2021 13:00,"Tell that to my 29 year old friend who was in the hospital for three weeks, and still occasionally needs supplemental oxygen. He's been unable to work since the start of November. Edit for clarity - he has been unable to work his _desk_ job

Or another co-worker who is 35 and has been too out of breath to keep his normal workout routine the last three weeks. His case by definition was mild, yet I definitely wouldn't call him fine yet.

I don't know if under 30 counts towards your youngest 1/3 category, but man, he definitely should have gotten vaccinated. Even if it's not widespread, if getting vaccinated could prevent thousands of young people like my friend going through what he went through, I really see no reason not to do it."

Even though i was sitting down all day. I felt like it was pure torture being in my body. I never felt okay. Always felt really sick. This lasted for like a whole year. I slowly got better, super slowly. It wasn't until last 6 months that i saw some noticable improvements. November i actually noticed i had improved a huge amount. But i got my booster and it pushed me back like 6 months in my progress. I have daily migrains again, and just a laundry list of issues. When i feel a crash coming or like shit. All i do is lay in bed for hours and suffer. Waiting to get over it.

It sucks balls, i hate it. Especially when everyone around me thinks i can push passed it. They all go out and move so freely in their bodies. Meanwhile my life for the past two years has been suffering day in and day out and wishing for better days. Which do come, dont get me wrong. But it's felt like forever. I forget what being healthy was tbh.


In the end. In just happy im alive and have people to help support me. Unemployment money also literally saved me.

That said, my parents are in their 50s and are the oldest people I know who have caught it recently... however my grandfather who was 90 caught Covid in hospital about a month ago (so presumably Delta) and he died from it despite being double vaxxed, so I think Omicron could still be very bad if a big wave hits the older age groups."

12/18/2021 12:53,"6 months is just the time we tested it at.  Longer is probably better and shorter worse.

Where we are now is that most of the population will catch Omicron over the next few weeks.  A boost dose can reduce this chance and reduce severity if you are infected.

You should get a booster asap, unless someone older/more vulnerable can take that dose instead.  We need to give out every dose we have ASAP to the oldest person available.  If we had enough doses everyone should get a booster tomorrow."
12/18/2021 12:53,Also 3-4 weeks between doses isn't optimal either. Canada delayed it for weeks and it showed a very solid response against Delta.
12/18/2021 12:52,"Don't know what you're on about, dude. The disease will definitely become endemic. Between vaccination for new strains (remember, an Omicron-tailored vax will work against Omicron descendants, and we already have a great vaccine for Delta), antiviral treatments (much broader), the hammer that will come from everyone getting Omicron (sadly), vaccinating children and other developments, we definitely are on our way towards ameliorating the situation.

The next few months will be rocky. That does not mean every winter is going to be. The Spanish Flu became endemic, too. This isn't going to be a forever problem. There is even work being done on stuff like universal coronavirus vaccines (would be super cool)."
12/18/2021 12:52,"From the table, I see that Omicron is four-fold in 3 days (so, not doubling), while Delta rose 10% in 6 days (which is far from doubling every 11 days)."

12/18/2021 12:51,"Exactly, and that is why we need a long term solution on how to deal with this. 2G, increased testing, more vaccination, a more flexible home office system can all be part of the toolbox after the worst is over."

12/18/2021 12:47,"Sounds like we might be living in similar countries when it comes to vaccination rates. Depending on what type of vaccine you get and what covid variant we’re talking about, one dose of a vaccine does usually not even count as being fully vaccinated. 
Two doses are great, but after about 12 weeks the protective effect is going down dramatically, hence boosters are now recommended after 3 months. 
If you get a breakthrough infection anyway, you should be really well protected, but this is based on some small studies and is preliminary (there’s an article in JAMA, if you’d like, I can find the link). But it makes sense- if you get sick first and then get vaccinated, you’re also pretty well protected. 

New variants are complicating things somewhat, so now there’s some talk of changing the meaning of fully vaccinated to only include those who also got boosters."

12/18/2021 12:43,"I don't think we have science to explain or predict what's going on right now with Omicron. Epidemiologists and virologists will be studying it for a long, long time.  This is one of the most unique events we've ever had the technology to observe.

That said, if we had a multivalent delta+omicron vaccine it would absolutely also be 95% effective against infection.  The vaccines we do have show the spike protein of the original covid to the immune system, teaching it not only how to make antibodies against the spike but also *to target the spike*. Omicron's spike is dramatically different, but the spike protein is still the target. The training still works.

Most of the population is going to catch Omicron over the next 2 weeks.  Anyone young is extremely likely to be fine; your immune systems are still hard-working and they will figure out what to do.  The important thing is to not spread it to the elderly, or for them to do whatever they can not to catch Omicron over the next several weeks."
12/18/2021 12:43,"You misunderstood, I can see why since it is worded awkwardly. Their preliminary evidence is showing that boosters don’t work as well against preventing infection by Omicron as they do against delta, but they do improve your chances of not getting infected much more than just two doses. They mention two weeks after a shot since that is a normal time point to compare vaccine efficacy. 

>Depending on the estimates used for vaccine [AZ and Pfizer] effectiveness against symptomatic infection from the Delta variant, this translates into vaccine effectiveness of between 0% and 20% after two doses, and between 55% and 80% after a booster dose."

We have high numbers of covid high numbers or regular health problems and high numbers of health problems from delayed care during the pandemic. And not enough nurses. Nurses are quitting left and right! And nurses are getting sick from caring for these patients.
12/18/2021 12:39,"Look, everyone should care about infection. It’s got nothing to do with age and everything to do with comorbidities. But even those aren’t a given. A friend in her 30s was just hospitalised and she got it from an elderly family member who was fine after a week. Hospital admissions of kids are rising as well in the UK, in SA….

12/18/2021 12:32,"People are mistakenly assuming homogeneity in the populations being infected. Delta's doubling rate is now slow because the high-risk parts of society (non-mask-wearing socialites, etc.) have already had Delta and are now mostly immune to Delta, but they're still very vulnerable to Omicron due to immune escape. 

Omicron is likely mainly infecting these people at this stage, because they are still living the same high-risk lifestyles that made them Delta-immune. Once enough of them have been infected, they'll hopefully have some Omicron-immunity and Omicron's spread is likely to slow as it works its way through the lower-risk populations.

The partial immunity from prior Delta infection in this high-risk population adds another big confounder: people who have already been Delta-infected may be less likely to end up in hospital as their immune system was already partially prepared. If Omicron is currently mostly infecting high-risk people, that's likely why the hospitalization rate is lower. Once Omicron has had time to seep into the low-risk-but-less-immune population, the hospitalization rate may rise."
12/18/2021 12:31,"UK data shows that 2-dose efficacy *for young people* is really good, and young people don't need to care about infection anyway.  Anyone over 50/60/70 really needs another vaccine dose immediately."

12/18/2021 12:19,"Ok, that's admittedly a confusing, arguably outright false statement (because non-scientific summaries of articles are frequently *horrifyingly* inacurate representations).

In actuality, as you probably know, all well-gathered evidence is evidence, but it may be *weak* evidence, as is the case here.

What scientists actually mean when they make a statistically-informed statement like this is that there is *insufficient* evidence to say that there is a difference.

As a simple example, say I have a coin and want to make sure that it is actually completely fair for the Superbowl kickoff toss. I take the coin and flip it four times. Every time it lands on heads.

At this point, I could do two things: panic, because kickoff is about to start, and things initially look bad OR recognize that there is a 0.5^4 = 0.0625 chance of that happening (twice that if you also count the all tails case!), which means... I need more data!

I flip the coin a bunch more times and then check again. The specific way to figure out how many times to flip the coin is called hypothesis testing, and is the cornerstone of modern science. If it were an amazingly unfair coin that somehow landed on heads 90+% of the time, it might not take many trials to show this. If it were skewed 55% to 45% though, you could absolutely still demonstrate that it was unfair, but it would take much longer.

The statistical analyses involved here in the case of COVID are much more complex, but the premise is the same: weak effects require more data to demonstrate. The chance that Omicron and Delta are EXACTLY the same given that they have different sequences and viral lineages (parents) would be sort of like flipping a coin and having it land on its side. Theoretically possible, but REALLY unlikely. One is almost certainly a least a little more severe than the other, but so far we don't have enough data (i.e. statistical power) to say which.

P.S. it's VERY important to note here that this effect exists: https://xkcd.com/882/. That's why it's important for scientists to publish their data early so that we can compare studies and arrive at the real conclusion more rapidly. It's *totally normal* for studies to be conflicting at this point. That's just a mathematical fact, called small sample bias. It might be frustrating, but it doesn't mean that scientists are wrong or making this up as they go along.

My advice? Play this conservatively - if it's ACTUALLY bad, you'll look like a genius and protect yourself in the process. If it's actually not so bad? Well... I guess that would be refreshing heading all the way into year three. Global pandemics are the sort of thing you want to look like you're overreacting to, exactly because there's that small chance that the early data was a very unrepresentative sample."

Also worth noting, in medical fields they specifically require negative pressure ventilation (where the pressure drop at the outlet is greater than that at the fresh air inlet) for infectious disease containment rooms. And, in the start of this current pandemic there was a lot of covid spread in hospital  as a result of not having the correct type of ventilation.

I'm no expert on aerospace ventilation, but the fact they call it pressurising the cabin leads me belive this is probably the exact opposite of a negative pressure ventilation system. Also, and I could be wrong, but I'm thinking if the pressure inside the plane was less than the outside at 20,000 feet, everyone would just die. 

But, let's think about the fluid dynamics of the situation. Yes the cabin is being supplied with fresh air, above each passenger. Then what happens? I assume every plane is different but if also assume the easiest path is air flows from that seat, backwards until it gets to the vent at the back of the plane. It would be diffused yes, but it's also contacting every passenger on the way past.

Then we should consider what it takes to catch Covid. 15 mins in close contact of an infectious person is virtually 100% guarantee then its a sliding scale from there. The real question we need to model here is ""if the person in the front seat of the plane is highly infectious, what does the distribution of particles throughout the fuselage actually look like?"" The answer is: there will be a base level of particles in the air constant for the entire flight, varying at different positions, increasingly more concentrated the closer you get to the infectious person. Unless of course the air vacuum runs the length of the cabin floor, along the sides (Although that seems unlikely due to excess weight) Well the same is still true but air will flow sideways instead of backwards. So in that case infectious person in the middle is worst position."

12/18/2021 11:59,"At this point it appears to be more virulent and spreading extremely fast. The news about it being milder should be taken with a huge pinch of salt, because A: the data is still coming in and so far the evidence for it being milder isn’t conclusive and B: since it’s so fast at spreading, even if it were milder, it’s a huge problem. Imagine just having a company and within a week having all your staff come down with the flu. It’s just the flu, but if enough people get it at once, it can be pretty disruptive. This isn’t just the flu, it’s way more serious, causes long term problems, is deadlier and spreads faster: read it’s very bad bad bad."

We put in a bunch of extra negative controls, repeated tests we weren’t sure about and other measures to ensure the equipment wasn’t picking up some kind of contamination.

There’s no reference in the paper to the actual prevalence of fever in these patients that I could find.

What does the picture look like when you actually have no surveillance bias?

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.03.21252086v1.full

About 22% of cases experience fever.  Less than one in four.  Still the third most common symptom, but less than one in four?  Not really strongly correlated with Covid.  Shortness of breath in the other hand is more like 42%.

As I said, for most papers that remove selection bias, fever is in a surprisingly small number of patients.  (Keep in mind that fever, as a medical term, is different than “elevated temperature”)

We know with the other strains, infection confers a good level of immunity, it that less likely to be the case with Omicron and we might see people being reinfected multiple times over shorter timescales?


By the way, I live in London (UK) where cases are absolutely skyrocketing right now and Omicron is now dominant, and anecdotally I can confirm that everyone I know is testing positive. Everyone. Not just the unvaxxed people, not just the ones who don't wear masks and go out partying, everyone. It's insane, it really feels like it's just inevitable at this stage that the entire population will get it, the rate of spread is just unprecedented. Whether it causes a similarly big wave of hospitalisations, only time will tell, but I hope you are all ready for this. Get your boosters."

12/18/2021 11:35,"This is how scientific reporting works.

Basically, the null hypothesis here from a scientific standpoint is that Omicron produces infection equally severe to that produced by Delta. If you want to say otherwise, you need to statistically demonstrate that there is a difference.

In this case, because preliminary data helps plan health responses and can be aggregated in meta-studies to produce a clearer picture of the actual disease, it's important to publish that data, even if the results so far are ""we lack statistical power to demonstrate a significant difference between these two viruses"".

Notably, when you're taking about population statistics, which include public health, you need to be *extra* cautious about statistical methodology, because there are always uncontrolled confounding variables that can skew the analysis if not accounted for.

This isn't necessarily bad news, and it's not good news either. We would LIKE for there to be data that even in small sample sizes there are hugely statistically significant differences. That's what early vaccine studies showed for example, and it's what you expect to see when there's a really extreme difference in things.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m not against lockdowns per sé, but it needs to be executed in a effective way, one way that quickly brings numbers down. 

In the Netherlands there is a working from home advise, but employers can still demand that people come into the office. It is advised that you only have 4 visitors per day, but 90% of the people I know is not following this, as it is just an advise. Working and socializing will still be major spreading events. The prevalence of the omicron variant in a few days will be so high that you can assume that you will be infected.

12/18/2021 11:22,"> People just don't care.

If you ever ask an anti-masker why wearing a tiny piece of cloth is such a big deal whether they believe it works or not it becomes very clear that not caring is the crux of it.

They consider themselves immune or safe from serious consequences and anyone else they hurt in the process is of absolutely no concern or they actively take pleasure in hurting others. They've given up any argument for why wearing a mask isn't possible or detrimental and have settled on not giving a fuck about anyone else as their default state. They don't wear a mask because it's more work to do so than not and ""it only works to protect others"" so ""why should they bother""

It's a disturbingly selfish state of mind when the minimal effort of putting on a mask is too much because it would be for someone else not for themselves.

I guess the lesson here is we never should have been telling people that masks work better at protecting others because it just gave the most selfish among us an excuse to be against it.

And to be clear: Masks are *more effective* at protecting others but they do also help to protect yourself. The messaging has just been twisted into absolutes like so many other things in politics."

The biggest meme I've heard this entire time is ""I can breath fine in my mask, it's the same as no mask"". As someone whose spent a lot of time in legitimate masks, including rated for chemical and biological warfare masks, no, the simple laws of physics say you should definitely have a harder time breathing in a mask.

No, but the UK has some of the best large scale sequencing infrastructure in the world, and viral genomes aren't that large (relatively cheap to sequence). The UK has submitted some 5000 omicron genome sequences and 151,000 delta genome sequences to the public GISAID repository in just the past 4 weeks. The USA, Germany, and Denmark are no slouches either, they've each submitted tens of thousands of sars-cov-2 genome sequences in the past 4 weeks. This is plenty enough genome sequencing data to see how omicron frequency is rapidly increasing in multiple countries.

\*Like, I seriously can't understate how much sequencing the UK does. The UK has literally genome sequenced like 10% of all their positive COVID tests results. More than 1 million genome sequences deposited in GISAID out of some 11 million cumulative positive test cases. Imagine doing statistics with a sample size one-tenth of the population you're sampling from. It's not child's play, but it is the result of decades of infrastructure investment in DNA sequencing."

We don't have 2-4 months.  Onicron takes 4 weeks to hit it's peak.

We can not shut down as it will make little difference.  Everyone is going to be exposed to onicron.  If the vaccines hold up we will get sick, but not that sick.

Afterwards large groups of the population will have natural and vaccine immunity.  Covid should go away at least for a little while.

This could be the end of the pandemic."

And suppose it takes five days between a person’s getting infected and their infecting others. After 30 days, the more transmissible virus is now causing 26, or 64, times as many new cases as the less transmissible one."""

Pretty bad timing. I'd argue that too many people have been led to believe that they are not high enough risk to need a booster, or that a combination of natural immunity and vaccination would do the trick to deliver 'long term' protection. This information has stuck with the public despite the existence of looming mutations and the knowledge of covid becoming endemic and never going away. There has been a massive mishandling of public health recommendations and this upcoming wave of Omicron is the price we are going to pay for all of it."

I work a cashiering job while I’m in school and no one in my state wears a mask and sometimes people try to get cute with me when I’m double masked so I know I’d get a shitload of comments if I wore a typical respirator. With omicron going around and living with an immunocompromised person I don’t want to get them sick.
12/18/2021 10:24,"If this causes less severe disease, this might be the best thing to happen to us.

Everyone is boosted and vaccines should give us great protection.

Here is the thing though, everyone is getting omicron.  No closing down or anything is going to stop it.  It peaks in countries in 4 weeks.

Testing everyone and asking them to stay home will shut down countries' infrastructures.

It will be interesting to see what happens.

My prediction is at-risk individuals will need to self isolate and the working population will all get sick and only stay home if they have symptoms.

The good news is after everyone gets sick we should get some sort of herd immunity.

As scary as this looks, I think we are looking at the start of the end of the pandemic.  You will get omicron in the next two months so please take care of your health.  Get vaccinated and take vitamin D and sink."

On a 1-2 hour flight, unless you're a literal infant, you can probably survive by eating before and after the flight.

12/18/2021 10:16,"If a virus is so lethal that it kills most of its host/victims before being able to transmit to other potential hosts that virus will ""burn itself out"" even amongst the unvaccinated and previously unexposed.

This is exactly what happened with SARS-COV-1. It was 10x more lethal than this current SARS-COV-2, and in combination with mitigation efforts it burned itself out.

Omicron is a direct result of evolution brought on by people having some sort of immunity weather by natural immunity or vaccination. The virus had to change in order to ""survive"" so it became ""less lethal"" but much more transmissable.

THE TRADEOFF/CATCH: It's a numbers game at this point in the pandemic. The more unexposed/unvaccinated/partially vaccinated hosts that can be potentially infected by the Omicron Variant the more people will get hospitalized although the overall percentage in relation to ""infection"" will be lower. Which ultimately will lead to more death. WHICH IS EXACTLY WHY this Omicron Variant is so concerning.

At best it would somewhat slow down the wave. And such a lockdown as seen in Songbird isn’t realistic either. There are people who have to manufacture and deliver the essential products we consume and utility workers who have to work as well. Plus police, fire, and ambulance. Even with the most bare bone structure, there will still be enough people who can’t isolate 24/7 to allow spread.

- most likely offices won't have a forced closure, which probably means half of the managers will still demand their employees to enter their desk of contagion.

- authorities can't inspect the interior of homes unless there's something like an illegal drug plantation, which means that house parties are likely to be found everywhere.

- religious institutions are also just advised to close but as happened before, especially reformed churches will keep open their doors and let in hundreds of churchgoers without any social distancing.

This is just the tip of the iceberg of our inconsistencies during past lockdowns, which was one of the reasons why the duration of the last lockdown (winter 2020-2021) was so excessive."

Omicron's direct ancestor is B.1, which was prevalent in Johannesburg in (southern hemisphere) winter of 2020. Delta's direct ancestor is B.1.1, which was highly prevalent in Mumbai in (northern hemisphere) summer/fall of 2020.   Both are conjectured (along with every other VOC) to have evolved in a single unvaccinated immunocompromised long-term host with a persistent infection.  If we had vaccines or masks in June 2020 (and the conjectures are correct) for those two people we could have prevented this.  We did not have vaccines then."
