2021-01-01T15:26:06Z,The U.S. Government has abandoned their citizens. Maybe we stop paying taxes?
2021-01-03T00:14:49Z,How can we call ourselves the “Greatest Nation in the World” & have people going hungry & homeless?
2021-01-01T22:22:07Z,Wealthiest country in the world. Dispicible that so many struggle to feed their families.
2021-01-01T22:57:21Z,"The real irony, this country has most of the world’s richest people."
2021-01-01T12:34:08Z,"The apocalypse has truly revealed how poorly prepared this country was, no question there."
2021-01-01T12:32:01Z,"When making meals, think about beans and rice and tortillas. If you can. Soups can go along ways."
2021-01-01T15:53:08Z,The irony of living in the so-called “richest nation in the world “  with so much anxieties and trauma ....seems like irony is the new reality.
2021-01-02T18:47:56Z,Cut Military funding by 50% and maybe we wouldn't be hungry

2021-01-01T13:02:59Z,Prayers For Everyone Everywhere 🙏😊
2021-01-01T20:43:38Z,"Impossible to imagine what it's like to go hungry unless it happens to you . Is spite of all this , can we really call the U. S. the greatest country in the world ? Who are we kidding ?"
2021-01-01T13:50:54Z,Sh** starting to hit 🎯 the  fan ppl!! Get yourself ready!
2021-01-01T22:49:09Z,and the gov wants to send our money over seas while we starve
2021-01-01T15:29:19Z,"Yes, I thank GOD for the extra $300 it helps, not as much as the $600, especially when ur living on !130 a week minus state & taxes taken out ur left with $113.00 a week😕! Tell me if we don't need the help?!😕"
2021-01-01T23:14:39Z,"Uh, not sure where you got your facts, but an average ONE bedroom apartment in San Francisco costs $3,111. The apartments in the most affordable areas of the city average over $2,500 a month."
2021-01-01T21:45:56Z,a lot more people unemployed that don't qualify for benefits wake up
2021-01-02T00:56:56Z,I am donating the $600 “stimulus” check that I do not need to my local food bank.
2021-01-01T18:20:48Z,"The sad fact that gets overlooked here too is that when someone goes homeless, which many of those unable to pay rent already have, it takes even more money to get on your feet and stabilize.  Especially if a person has been evicted, many landlords take advantage of that and will charge a higher deposit to move into a place.  So, the $2,000 checks are not out of line.  Even for those who have not lost income during the pandemic, prices of common items have been driven up due to the panic buying.  Don't expect any of the talking heads in Washington to understand that.  They don't pay attention to that sort of thing because when you can always afford things instead of running a tight household budget, the increase in cost doesn't phase you.  It's going to be a long and painful road back, if we make it back!"
2021-01-02T18:50:07Z,You know its bad when we have a record amount of food being stolen from grocery stores
2021-01-02T14:55:34Z,"Allison, you need to fire your stylist and hair dresser asap!"
2021-01-02T05:48:18Z,"This coronavirus pandemic has shinned the light on a whole lot of things like how greedy, and corrupt these politicians really are, and how so little they care about the average Joe out here trying to make an honest living."
2021-01-01T22:30:28Z,Why isn't the senate stepping up?
2021-01-08T19:12:40Z,You seriously think any if those companies ate going to give any money for food? Or that the foundations are going to buy food for people before they give themselves a pay raise? Wow
2021-01-02T21:37:31Z,News segments like this make people not reach out for help. “How sad” blah blah blah when instead they could be saying “these brave people are out here getting the help they need for their families” or maybe “ it’s great to see the community come together in a crisis” this segment just adds to the shame these people feel having to even ask.
2021-01-02T23:12:28Z,I'd like to see some of these big corporations and congressman and just the rich to start putting some money out there for the food banks to help feed the poor
2021-01-02T10:14:23Z,Why I don’t see any like this in Fresno? My family need food I’m a single mom no work. Someone pls let me know of any help In Fresno
2021-01-09T12:12:12Z,Blame the government for mismanagement of the country.
2021-01-05T07:12:37Z,People need jobs to be independent and be able to live on their own.Their government failed them and yet some still support Trump fervently. So sad to live through these times in US.

2021-01-02T14:52:25Z,P!nk's got a side hustle!
2021-01-03T07:37:18Z,"""According to a 2016 EPA study, America throws away more than 38 million tons of food every year"" and there is no enough food to go around to those in need? GIVE ME A BREAK!"
2021-01-04T11:09:15Z,Government fails.
2021-01-01T17:16:42Z,"This was going to happen when the government shuts down businesses and limits the production of the businesses that are still open to less then 50 percent. In many cases they are cut to 30 percent capacity. This means that businesses that are still open in person are loosing 50 to 70 percent of their normal customers while open using the social distancing guidelines. Then businesses have to cut labor to adjust to cost of living expenses and the loss of profit. The best way to stimulate an economy is to open it up. The risks associated with closed businesses far outweigh the effects of keeping businesses at full bloom. Anyways this virus is not a pandemic. It does do some damage to thos infected. However the death rate is not that high when you compare it to other pandemics. The same with the infection rates. The Spanish Flu closed down the economy for far greater consequences for keeping the economy open. A way higher infection rate and death rate. We did not have vaccines at that time and doctors did cause a lot of the deaths with their treatments. Based off history this will be over with by June with people developing their own antibodies against the virus. Once you get the virus there is no need to get the vaccine. You either built up antibodies for it or unfortunately still suffering with the virus or ended the persons life by causing many complications that are still being researched. Scientists still do not totally  understand it, but at least next time we could have an upper hand."

2021-01-01T13:12:13Z,its better to have a slightly less effective vaccine thats 100x easier to administer... the nmra vaccines have no future
2021-01-01T14:47:10Z,coronavirus 2021
2021-01-15T13:39:26Z,Just saw a news story about people delivering the vaccine to remote villages in Alaska. Someone explain to me why people can’t get enough doses for people right here in Brooklyn N.Y. .🤔😷
2021-01-01T17:59:09Z,The corporment and the compliant
2021-01-01T13:30:00Z,You can tell that the people in charge haven't a clue.
2021-01-01T15:19:03Z,idiotism at full speed...part protection vaccines for everyone... genaues.
2021-01-01T17:18:39Z,Confusing... suspicious???
2021-01-01T14:36:20Z,They have had a few months to get it together.  Total losers. They are intentionally going slow. I don't know why. But it has to deal with money and power.
2021-01-01T14:52:52Z,delivery of first🥇 dose💉💉💉💉should be prioritized
2021-01-01T13:44:24Z,What happens when you don't take the whole antibiotic treatment?
2021-01-01T13:20:03Z,"Being the human immune system is more reliable with less side effects , I think it's going to be ok. On a serious note. , all the vaccine companies state in their paper work this does not stop the transmission only ""might"" lesson symptoms. no different than the flue shot they can't sell. So why all the misery ?"
2021-01-01T15:58:47Z,"If there’s a shortage of vaccines in England why would he care if Europe approves it, he can have all the jabs he needs himself with his own homebrew..."
2021-01-01T16:49:11Z,The world going down
2021-01-03T07:56:01Z,Do they actually have a plan or are they making it all up as they see fit 😂😂
2021-01-01T23:55:30Z,If we don't receive the vaccine properly (as in getting the right number of jabs at the right intervals)  we could risk giving the virus a chance to mutate against the vaccine right? I'm not sure but Dr Campbell seems to not be worried about this point.
2021-01-01T13:26:17Z,Cute anchor
2021-01-02T10:30:48Z,"Tiffany ponte Dover,,,,perfect example of unnecessary poisoning......the truth of facts cannot be chasdished....."
2021-01-01T21:07:37Z,"Yes it's all very well and dandy if the Oxford vaccine its more effective after 3 months, but what about the Pfizer one??! No one seems to be talking about how they're delaying a vaccine that has NO data as to whether it's more effective or not?? So why are you delaying both then? Hmm?"
2021-01-02T10:05:03Z,"The essential data collected by me on phase 1 of the Pfizer vaccine trial, which can be evaluated on the basis of logical-linguistic parameters, can be summarized as follows: 1) FDA, in a document of 11 December 2020 with which it approved the Pfizer vaccine, which bears the pompous title ""FDA Takes Key Action in Fight Against COVID-19 By Issuing Emergency Use Authorization for First COVID-19 Vaccine"", claims that the efficacy of the vaccine, based on the data provided by the trial, reaches 95%, but in its final evaluations it states verbatim that ""At this time, data are not available to make a determination about how long the vaccine will provide protection, nor is there evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from person to person, namely: "" 2) AIFA, in the faq n. 31 of its official website, it is not known on the basis of what data other than those provided by the FDA, reduces the percentage of effectiveness to just over 90%, but admits in turn that ""a portion of vaccinated people will not develop the immune defense "", And above all that"" we still do not know definitively if vaccination only prevents the manifestation of the disease or even the transmission of the infection "". 3) The New England Journal of Medicine, in an article written by the leading scientists, entitled ""Safety and Efficacy of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine"", states that ""few participants in both groups had adverse reactions that led to withdrawal from the trial. No deaths were considered by investigators to be vaccine-related or placebo-related. No deaths associated with Covid-19 were observed. No stopping rules were met during the reporting period. Safety monitoring will continue for 2 years after the administration of the second dose of vaccine ""Regardless of the general insignificance of the whole, we still acknowledge that there are no people who died of placebo: it is already something. In practice, despite the alleged effectiveness between 90% and 95%, for now we are dealing with a vaccine conceived as follows: a) it is not known ""definitively"" whether the vaccine prevents the manifestation of the disease. b) it is not known whether and for how long it provides protection; c) it is not known whether it can prevent the transmission of the Covid-19 from person to person; d) it is already well known that it will not be able to immunize all vaccinated subjects;       %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%   If someone asks himself about the things that surround him and does not find logical explanations for certain events, even scientific ones, he has every right to be a “denier”, if ever this word makes sense in such a delicate issue for the health of citizens as the experimentation and use of a vaccine. Regarding the new vaccine Pfizer, for example, I cannot understand the logic inherent in the comparison between the “adverse reactions” found in the control group and those that occurred in the placebo group. In fact, I wonder how it is possible to compare the adverse reactions of those who have taken a vaccine with those who have not taken it, since the only element in common that binds the two groups is only a skin injection and not what was injected in the body? Apart from the material consequences of this injection, in fact, the adverse reactions of the control group were caused by the intake of the vaccine, but those of the placebo group from what? Ultimately, any complication that occurs in the placebo group cannot provide a comparison with those in the control group, unless one improperly considers the onset of the disease in someone of the placebo group for not taking the vaccine, fact which cannot be proved, and which, in any case, is certainly not an adverse reaction to anything. In light of the above, and taking into account the fact that both FDA and AIFA, in their official documents, admit they don’t know either the vaccine coverage times (if it ever exist), or whether the vaccine itself is able to prevent person-to-person transmission, is not conceivable that someone,  even only at the level of hypothesis, plane to make this vaccine mandatory. Things are the same for the Oxford and Moderna vaccines.  How can you think of making vaccines like these mandatory?"
2021-01-02T20:45:05Z,Sorry it's hopeless to think people will cooperate on a level needed to make any headway against this virus. I see only successful vaccine widely used as only hope in the next year.
2021-01-02T16:59:52Z,"The statement that implies that it ""works best"" if you get the second dose at three weeks is unproven, and probably not true. It just hasn't been tested. The clinical trials focused on the one scenario - getting the second dose at three weeks - and therefore the data from that trial is only really valid if that same protocol is followed. We may learn quickly that a delayed second dose may actually even prove better. I'm guessing that the reason that they didn't test other timeframes was because of the extreme urgency to get a vaccine out. Given that covid-19 will probably continue to be in human reservoirs for a long time (esp considering we haven't managed to totally eradicate polio), they'll probably end up finding the best way in coming months and years."
2021-01-01T15:00:54Z,what if you are uninterested in the vaccine like me
2021-01-02T05:08:55Z,They don’t mention Astra Zeneca haven’t proven that it works in the elderly because they bungled their clinical trials. It’s pathetic and laughable that they can’t properly conduct clinical trials. Half of their trial was on UK health care workers and not the general public and they pathetically included such a skewed demographic in their data. Their just desperate.
2021-01-01T13:56:36Z,hahaha even comdoms have 99%  protection the vacine has 95% and already  some people died by vacine...wait when corona 21 already appear....
2021-01-01T20:31:26Z,"Problem is though, like all things that seek survival, slow roll out and mixing of the virus and the vaccine will produce an offspring at some point that will circumvent the vaccine. Or as it is termed, vaccine escape. It is a thing and unless we give as many people as possible that initial jab, we will for at least the next 30-40- or beyond, years, be dealing with this coronavirus."
2021-01-01T15:25:37Z,"DW news. As Covid-19 expert . Thank you for addressing my recommendations to. DW report 2 days ago  ""we are still far from normality""  ==≠========================== DW.. Here are the reports we need in coming days (1) what are the preliminary advantages of Astrazeneca/Oxford (A/O) DNA based versus Pfizer/Biontech (P/B) Moderna mRNA based vaccines.  From cost of logistics alone..in my view P/B is 3rd.  (2) We need immediate discussion throughout Germany... what we can learn from A/O. long delay (A few months) between 1st and 2nd injection..  What it will mean the Germany economic recovery and social order integrity stabilization..  Germany must be agile... Priority must be securing social order by clear communication.. leading to more massive vaccination than what currently projected..  We should be able to think massively outside the box.. Given our limited initial quota of vaccine supply.. How can we disrupt this limitation by assuring 2x to 3x more people getting vaccinated  Let us be creative..  (3) There is no need to have 2 tier society.. Those who will be vaccinated and those are not... If we disrupt as I proposed in (2)  Germany do not have to end up like Spain... There is no need.. Spain context is different from Germany.. In the end.. the best approach is maximizing massive vaccination within short time.. This requires more creativity, open mindedness,be willing to explore new possibilities based on new and latest information  If Germany is willing to adopt agility... Germany can get out of this suffering early..  (4) Germany... wakeup... There must be assumption now the latest mutations, either from UK or South Africa, must have arrived in Germany.  UK mutation has arrived.  The latest data shows no different from what has been except 50 to 55 % increase in infectivity...  It took 3 to 4 months to become the dominant form in UK... It is not inconceivable that same thing will happen in other part of world.. Including Germany... This is simply how mutation spreads.. Proven in UK and South Africa...  Same stringent mask, hand washing, separate clothing, perhaps face shield will be sufficient to protect.. No big deal.  However.. Start looking for evidence how this contribute to the recent surge in no of cases and death...  Stop using reasons of backlog documentation.. That is not characteristics of Germany efficiency.  There are so many positive development to get Germany out of this crisis... Let us be creative, brave to disrupt, open minded and more out of box.  Germany can do this  We are Mobilizing as much from outside to coordinate people in Germany who are ready to response as written above.. to end Covid-19 suffering as soon as possibly achievable.  We can do this. 👍👍👍👍"
2021-01-02T10:42:17Z,If the vacinw is such a problem why are co many. countries doing it.lets get vacinated. Mark.
2021-01-01T13:16:31Z,Hysteria!
2021-01-01T13:55:09Z,My 3 year old could've done a better job with the vaccine rollout. At least he can count and divide up his toys evenly.
2021-01-01T13:54:10Z,"Since the Oxford vaccine is brand new, how does this so called expert knows that delaying the second dose will prolong the immunity.  Total garbage!"
2021-01-01T22:26:06Z,"If United States and Germany are delaying the second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, what is going on? Maybe they know something is wrong with this vaccine and the people are not telling us."
2021-01-01T17:37:19Z,"Then they should've told people beforehand. Having had the first dose you do feel like a bit of a guinea pig but it's alright because you're expecting the 2nd dose three weeks later. If immunisation would be the same or even better=longer lasting if you get the 2nd dose 12 weeks later why did Pfizer say three weeks in the first place? I live in Sweden and I had my first dose 30/12, expecting my 2nd around 20/1. I haven't heard anything different but I'll be very upset if the plans are changed."
2021-01-02T11:57:19Z,God is in control!♥ Pandemic will end

2021-01-02T12:00:01Z,"Even if you get the vaccine, you will be still spreading it if you contract the virus, so saying to vaccinate people to stop the spread of the virus is not accurate!"

2021-01-01T13:22:21Z,Medicine is fluid so they will delay second dose for Pfizer' Moderna' Astra Zeneca's 😷🤔 makes sense for AZ but others?
2021-01-01T14:53:29Z,It's really scary.. Imagine you get the first shot and you are not fully recovered. The virus will become stronger. Thus the next shot will not be effective. 🤔
2021-01-01T16:11:19Z,Keep it.. I won't be taking it
2021-01-01T16:26:07Z,The hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) tablets have been around for 50+/- years and are inexpensive. But that's the problem.
2021-01-01T18:15:03Z,Yes because our “ were number one!!” Country won’t consider Oxford vaccine til APRIL- seriously??? Geez can we say $$$$
2021-01-03T08:05:25Z,And nobody is talking about the fact that only viruses are kept at such a low temperature
2021-01-01T18:32:24Z,Not in the uk they saying second shot should be now be taken up to 3 months after the first shot
2021-01-01T15:52:56Z,Another example of Brussel's ineptitude 🤬 their slow response is going to cause thousands of deaths.
2021-01-02T17:09:27Z,There are videos showing that hospitals in the UK are empty and medical staff dancing......
2021-01-01T16:33:54Z,"the rules for vaccinations were made in base of the studies, 2 shots are needed between 3 weeks ( no 3 months), otherwise there is a false sensation of protection in the people and will be contagious situations anyway."
2021-01-01T20:42:18Z,"The doctors concur that Pfizer’s vaccine studies should be halted until a  credible study design can be presented, one that doesn’t falsify data  endpoints and one that addresses a host of serious safety concerns. The  doctors warn that Pfizer is conflating non-specific symptoms of illness  with COVID-19 diagnoses for the control arm while using inaccurate, high  cycle PCR tests for a diagnosis. The doctors warn that the vaccine’s  efficacy is being contorted because the study design fails to properly  diagnose cases of COVID-19 and fails to confirm infection using the  Sanger sequencing method. They conclude that risk of disease and  potential vaccine benefit cannot be measured or determined with  accuracy. They"
