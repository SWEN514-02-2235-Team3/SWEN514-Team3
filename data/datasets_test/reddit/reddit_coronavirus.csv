11/29/2021 6:37,I think it should be the subs copy copypasta tbh.
11/29/2021 6:37,">We already know it has the same amino acid substitutions as b.1.351 (Beta) plus a bunch of one of unknown impact.

Not exactly. The amino acid substitution that you are thinking of is at position E484 in the RBD. The Beta variant has an E484K mutation while Omicron has E484A. The RBD of the original spike protein (used in the vaccines) has Glutamate at E484. The Beta variant has Lysine (K) at E484. It looks like the Omicron variant has Alanine (A) in that position. The E484 position is a major target of immune reaction against the receptor binding domain, which seem to be the part of the spike that the immune system has the strongest reactions against."

Then again you could argue people not wearing masks are not being careful while doing other things, but that's just an hypothesis."

I don't have any human children, but I feed a colony of cats, and they're everything to me. I try to stay as healthy as I possibly can, to look after them. It feels like I'm living in a nightmare :("
11/29/2021 7:05,"seroprevalence in the infected has never gone over 27%

when you say it's in the eighties now it's because they are now including vaccinated blood serum in their testing

in other words you've literally just proven to everyone why we should all get vaccinated

because the immunity provided by infection isn't durable

[infection-induced seroprevalence estimates for persons aged 16 to 29 years (5.5% [95% CI, 4.6%-6.6%] in July 2020 and 27.0%](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2784013)"
11/29/2021 7:05,"That's true when looking at individual hosts in isolation, but not true when considering the macro social context. If a virus is more deadly, we'll lock down and create booster variants targeting it specifically. If a variant is less severe, we'll let it run rampant and eventually not even vaccinate for it (the common colds). Over time, the latter become the dominant strands."
11/29/2021 7:04,I don’t think it’s really a thing.  We recently travelled in for a vaccine only show and enjoyed the safe dining/venues compared to our home state.
11/29/2021 7:04,"The mistake here is thinking that travel bans in this situation is a punishment. The Governments of the US, UK, EU and other nations have protecting their citizens as their highest duty. They would be failing in this duty if they were to continue to allow unimpeded travel to and from a part of the world where this virus is spreading without knowing more about the scope of the spread in SA and the high potential for Omicron to evade exisiting antibodies.

 It is a quarantine to try to limit the spread of a potentially game changing virus to other parts of the world, not an imposition of economic sanctions."
11/29/2021 7:04,It can still mutate so you would want a combo of vaccinations and limiting the exposure and spread.
11/29/2021 7:03,"The number from Spanish flu is an estimate but you're using reported cases for COVID. If you used reported cases for Spanish Flu it would be like 500,000 . 

If you use a total case estimate for one you should also do so for the other. 

Last estimate I saw for total COVID deaths reported and unreported was 15 million+. This is the calculation used for your Spanish Flu numbers."

11/29/2021 7:02,"Easing of restrictions from the harshest lockdown in the developed world in Auckland that has lasted 3.5 months. And the easing for Auckland and some other regions is still some of the most restrictive in the world. 100 limit caps in restaurants, private homes  and all of this is contingent on the use of vaccine passports. If no vaccine passports used its even harsher capacity limits."
11/29/2021 7:02,No
11/29/2021 7:02,"There is also something clearly wring with the testing or testing verification system. Supposedly, everyone on those flights had to have a negative test to board (IMHO they should require vax too, but they don’t). I’ve heard a bunch of speculation as to why that ten percent wasn’t caught. Everything from fake test results being rampant, to tests not being accurate (OK, so require two maybe), to it being caught on the flight due to lack of masking/ventilation, or some combo. Stopping Covid from crossing friendly land borders is super hard but stopping it from flying all over the world unchecked should be easier and help slow these kinds of outbreaks."

11/29/2021 7:01,The only problem with that is it not yet know how effective the current vaccines are at limiting the spread and effects of Omicron; if it does spread more readily then having proof of vaccination for indoor activities isn't going to help that much.
11/29/2021 7:01,Either the current boosters are effective or there's no good reason to delay taking a new one anyway.

11/29/2021 7:00,Moderna’s vaccine candidate was developed in January of last year before more people in the world even heard about what was happening in Wuhan. The machine modeling aspect of vaccine development nowadays is what is completely misunderstood and mischaracterized as “rushed” development.
11/29/2021 7:00,"This is almost certainly an eventuality they’ve anticipated and planned for. I’m sure they were off and running by Thursday.

Such an amazing era we live in that that can happen!"
11/29/2021 7:00,"COVID has killed way more than that.

18 million to Spanish flu is a retrospective figure because nobody recorded cases back then.

COVID will have its own retrospective figure because more than half the countries again don't record case numbers worth anything. And even the ones that do are only getting ~1/2 of them. 

Worldwide I would be surprised if even 1/4 of COVID deaths are reported."
11/29/2021 7:00,"You’re obviously going to have to wait for the production… approval… distribution… the inevitable bottleneck for vaccines as everyone is going to want one at once.

Someone under the age of 50 probably wouldn’t realistically be eligible for a booster for another 8-9 months at the very earliest."
11/29/2021 7:00,"This is bullshit dude. This is all in your head.

Experts, the FDA, the CDC, Dr. Fauci, have been talking about the possibility of variants requiring a vaccine update from practically day one. 

Just because antivaxxers imagined an alternate reality where none of that happened doesn't mean anyone outside of your echo chamber is living in it."
11/29/2021 7:00,"There is selective pressure on a virus to mutate into a less deadly variant. Not so much at an individual level (where a long incubation can bypass that), but at a macro social level, where a more deadly virus will lead to lockdowns and dedicated boosters targetting it, whereas a less leathal version will generally be left to run rampant."
11/29/2021 7:00,Is milder cases confirmed with more sample sizes? Would be good if it wasn't serious like the south african doctor said and does anyone have more information on weird symptoms like high blood pressure?
11/29/2021 6:59,We have at least 2 to 3 more years of covid reality.
11/29/2021 6:59,Yes they are. Or at least part of it. If we had done that with the original strain  it may have been contained. All countries need to stop travel for a few weeks
11/29/2021 6:59,Yeah I don't know where this 'they know something we don't' narrative is coming from.
11/29/2021 6:59,Travel bans do not make sense unless they are across the board. We don’t know where omicron originated nor all the places it has already spread to.
11/29/2021 6:59,Thank fuck my county also has a low-incidence rate requirement for us to lose our public indoor mask mandate.
11/29/2021 6:59,"Completely agree. And I’m sure many will, which is really frustrating. The good news is that 94% of adults are vaccinated in Manhattan, 97% in Queens, Bronx, SI and Brooklyn follow (in that order from more to less) in the high 80’s. I don’t want a bunch of unvaccinated people here but at some point we have to just accept we have done all we can. That’s why I largely stick to neighborhood joints; I won’t be anywhere near tourist hotspots this season."
11/29/2021 6:59,"It's  free in govt hospitals and locations, but even the private ones charge pretty minimal fee(8-10 dollars max). They also take the sample at your home so you don't even have to travel anywhere. Also they are flying to fking Dubai, it's not like they have some money issues."

Money and the social status that comes with it are more important to most than the survival of their fellow humans.

11/29/2021 6:51,"nope. first of all immunity to that flu actually held and secondly it wasn't mutating into more deadly strains it was following the generally more common track of viruses which is to mutate into a less lethal strain.


[But every so often, direct descendants of the 1918 flu combined with bird flu or swine flu to create powerful new pandemic strains, which is exactly what happened in 1957, 1968 and 2009. Those later flu outbreaks, all created in part by the 1918 virus, claimed millions of additional lives, earning the 1918 flu the odious title of “the mother of all pandemics.”](https://www.history.com/news/1918-flu-pandemic-never-ended)

you are making your claims and statements based on incomplete and misunderstood information at best

at the moment though  the case numbers are really low and the daily test numbers show a good, low positivity rate"

11/29/2021 6:49,"Just a question. If the Omicron strain proves to have much milder symptoms, would it not be best to encourage that strain to become dominant over the more harmful ones? Kind of like selective breeding.  
  
I mean, either way we’re stuck with covid and exposure to a milder form of the virus is pretty much like traditional vaccines. The mortality rate is likely higher than a vaccine, but it’d do the job of “vaccinating” the antivaxxers, with a lower risk profile for those that are high risk.  
  
Idk, I’m no doctor or epidemiologist or whatever, so I’m quite prepared for this to be wrong on any number of fundamental levels, that are more obvious to someone that works in the field (so go easy on me). It was just a thought and a contagious “vaccine” would appear to circumvent the whole problem with vaccinations. Though I’m guessing that the vaccine manufacturers wouldn’t be too happy with that.  
  
Oh and perhaps omicron isn’t the right strain, but the same could be applied to a future strain with an even lower risk profile.  
  
Lastly, everyone who wants to, could still get vaccinated. Governments just wouldn’t have to push the issue so hard.

South Africa does a tiny amount of genetic sequencing on covid samples. As of when I checked yesterday 97 other countries/territories had sequenced a greater proportion of their positive tests than South Africa. The fact that despite that so many cases are being found in South Africa as opposed to in countries carrying out far more sequencing is a strong indicator that it originated there or in one of the nearby countries doing even less sequencing."

But this all presupposes that it actually came for SA. We aren’t even sure of that yet. Granted by all accounts it does seem that way but it hasn’t been confirmed the way beta was. 

Also fyi SA does a lot of genetic sequencing because that’s how we fight TB so we are set up for it. So yes, we probably do more genetic sequencing than a lot of developed countries and hence we find these mutations."

And I agree ppl should get the jab. That's why I'm vaccinated. It's not a cure, it's a harm reduction measure.  Others aren't vaxxed but I believe they still deserve to be treated. 

Also there ARE very simple preventative measures for smoking related cancer + being overweight + adult onset diabetes. Maybe not as easy as getting a jab but fairly easy. Stop smoking, stop ingesting garbage + lose weight.

“Omicron has an unprecedented number of spike mutations, some of which are concerning for their potential impact on the trajectory of the pandemic,” the WHO said. “The overall global risk related to the new variant of concern Omicron is assessed as very high.“

Further research was needed to better understand Omicron’s potential to escape protection against immunity induced by vaccines and previous infections, it said, adding that more data was expected in coming weeks.

“Covid-19 cases and infections are expected in vaccinated persons, albeit in a small and predictable proportion“, it added."

11/29/2021 11:42,"> How did it come from the UK with upmost confidence?

The UK was the first country where it became the dominant variants, by some margin. You'd expect that anywhere a variant with a transmission advantage is introduced, it will become dominant at some point and the sooner the variant is introduced, the sooner dominance is achieved.

The fact that Alpha became dominant in the UK well before it did anywhere else strongly suggests that it was introduced in the UK before it was introduced anywhere else, meaning it originated in the UK. That's not a certainty, but it's by far the most likely scenario."

there are other studies which say 80Celsius for couple of seconds is enough to kill the viruses if the heat is same all over the mask, so not only from one side"

11/29/2021 11:39,"No, T cells look at all proteins, not just the spike proteins like the antibodies.

You still have an immune response (they look at the whole virus, not just spike proteins). Imagine those people not having any vax or infection. Their T and B cells were never trained for covid and they have to respond from scratch. Vaccinated/already infected have already trained cells so they dont have to start from scratch, and the immune system reacts much faster. It is like a blueprint the body can immediately recover to quickly deal with any variant as it looks like largely the same virus.

Bodies dont like to keep antibodies it doesnt need, hence the reduction in antibodies over time. Thats why you have those T and B cells."
11/29/2021 11:39,"Mortality will have to wait a bit. Most covid strains appear to roughly kill below 1 in 200 infected, and it largely takes several weeks to die.

The new strain just started spreading, and we probably don't even have 200 sequenced cases yet, and certainly not 4 weeks post infection. News will come out of SA in a couple of weeks, unless things are going really well or badly."

If vaccinated people are spared most of the trauma of the illness (generally, there'll be exceptions obvs) the unvaxxed will mainly take out each other. We all know that.
And yes medical staff will end up having to triage. And people will die. And others who DO need treatment will die waiting. As they do now.

One thing about Japan that hasn't been reported in western media is the attitude in the rural areas towards covid. I live in a rural area, lots of older people, not as many medical facilities. In April 2020 one college-aged girl brought back covid and it spread to her family that lives here. That family eventually moved because they were ostracized by their neighbors so much. People here were probably more afraid of the social consequences of getting covid than the virus itself. That kind of pressure from nosy gossipy old folks in rural communities probably did more to keep covid numbers down than anything the government did."

I was a student at a large university in a major European city. Our university security guards didn't even have sticks/batons let alone guns. I went to study abroad in the US at a small, private college of about 3,000 students. I was amazed to see the campus police driving around in big SUVs with guns on their holsters. It was very disconcerting since their main job was to stop 18-20 year old from drinking."

Same with smokers - should they be denied care? No, not typically. But if they were overwhelming the healthcare system, then I think you could make a solid case for putting them to the back of the line. Just like you could argue as such for anti-vaxxers now."
